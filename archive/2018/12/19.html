<pre>The contestants on Jeopardy! are idiots. They don&#39;t even know basic facts; &quot;Who&#39;s George Washington?&quot;, &quot;Where is Spain?&quot;, etc. These are our trivia champions? These are our venerated intellectuals?</pre>

<pre>Black people are so harsh on themselves. I&#39;ve had many positive experiences. I&#39;d happily &quot;go back&quot;! If some bigots never would, it&#39;s their loss.</pre>

<pre>Why is it such a selling point for The Phantom of the Opera, to be the longest-running musical on Broadway? 30 years? Man, that&#39;s too long. I can barely sit through a two hour musical.</pre>

<pre>Mario games are good in proportion to the average number of exits from a level. SMB 1 through 3, good. Mario World, better. Mario 64, the best. Donkey Kong? Eh… Given this statistical pattern, I must theorize that the levels of Mario games are fundamentally displeasurable.</pre>

<pre>What is interesting in math is often the process of getting from a simple concept which generates seemingly complicated behavior back down to a simple observation, by finding the right angle from which to view it.</pre>

If it was obvious on first sight, if there was never any moment lost in the wilderness, it wouldn&#39;t have been interesting.</pre>

<pre>We wouldn&#39;t care about this distribution if primes weren&#39;t a simple and thus natural concept; we wouldn&#39;t care about this regularity, or even consider it a &quot;regularity&quot; or &quot;pattern&quot; if the Prime Number Theorem&#39;s statement wasn&#39;t simple, and…</pre>

I sip on hot cocoa in my smoking jacket, then stroll leisurely to the laptop and post &quot;I&#39;ll never stop fucking and sucking! If there&#39;s one fact you can count on, I fuck&#39;n&#39; suck!&quot;.</pre>
