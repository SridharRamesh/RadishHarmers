<pre>The debate about self-care, boundaries, etc, makes no sense, as nobody thinks you owe others no kindness, and nobody thinks you are entitled to nothing you want for yourself. It&#39;s just people shouting &quot;Remember A&quot;, &quot;How dare you forget B?&quot;, &quot;How dare you forget A?!&quot;, to and fro.</pre>
