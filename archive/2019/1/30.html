<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We need more presidents like Ronald Reagan, who always wore a jacket in the White House because he constantly felt a little chilly, due to his decaying, diseased mind. On those rare occasions he forgot the jacket, it was also due to the same chaotic decay. Truly the last great.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@Baddiel @Tankie_Viciedo You&#39;re the one who said &quot;there&#39;s an unconscious anti-Semitic effect here&quot;, dude. I&#39;m all for reading people correctly, but I can&#39;t see a way to read this where you didn&#39;t say this. If it&#39;s incongruous with other words you tossed in, that&#39;s only the incoherence of what you said.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ADtheG @Tankie_Viciedo @Baddiel This didn&#39;t start because some guy said &quot;The Holocaust and colonialism were exactly the same in all respects&quot;. Rather, this all started because some guy called Winston Churchill a &quot;white supremacist mass murderer&quot;. The facts support the elements of that quoted description.</p></blockquote>

By this time next year, I hope to return to Encarta exclusively. Then after a few years practice with that, let&#39;s say by 2025 at latest, I aim to be a proudly fuckable owner of all 32 volumes of the final Britannica (2010).</p></blockquote>

Sure, I edited a few when I was younger, we all make mistakes in our youth, but I&#39;ve learnt since then. My resolve stays strong even when reading the most egregious typos.</p></blockquote>
