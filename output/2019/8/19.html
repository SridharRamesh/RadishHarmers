Text: I didn't really like OUATIH, it was a bit too plotless for me (and when things finally do happen, it's only just the same ending we've seen before several times now). Not that interesting. But wow, some people have been trained to give such weirdly dumb criticism instead.

Text: I may give it a rewatch just to see if it grows on me. Knowing ahead of time not to expect much plot often helps me enjoy this sort of movie more. I expect I still won't get much interesting out of the ending; it was fresh in Inglourious Basterds, now it's too rote.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby The ending violence is pretty boring to me, but not on "A fictional man shouldn't attack women(??)" grounds. Also, the scene with Bruce Lee was one of the more interesting parts to me, yet folks are angry the Asian wasn't shown in just a flatly reverent way, drained of character.

Text: @silvascientist Suppose, for example, that I wish to visualize an 11-dimensional space. I simply visualize an n-dimensional space, and then set n to 11.

More generally, in order to visualize space with D many dimensions, I simply visualize an n-dimensional space, and then set n to D.

Text: @ILikeCereal13 Yes, those are the ones I'm referring to. I liked the ending in Inglourious Basterds, where it was a shocking surprise. I was already bored of it by Django Unchained, which I thought was a much lesser film. I've yet to find many who agree with me, though. To each, their own.

Text: They should combine all the awards into one, given to just the single best person or thing each year. If the year's best makeup for a single-camera series (non-prosthetic) is better than the year's best chemist, give it to the makeup. Everything else is rewarding mediocrity.

Text: One day, I will awake and find I've forgotten how to walk. It is to be expected. Memory goes in one's old age, and I learnt it so long ago; a toddler at the time. Just the way of the world. Both my grandfathers got so old, they forgot their initial lessons in being alive.
