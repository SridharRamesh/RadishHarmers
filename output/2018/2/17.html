Text: @ManCaveJokes (Apart from that, I think he's one of the funnier guys here, but I'm never entirely sure how much he's dryly joking, and how much I'm only interpreting him that way when he may actually be more sincere in his posts than I realize. Thus, I cowardly refrain from Liking any of it.)

Text: @quasicoherence Sure; I mean, I'm not claiming it is. That's precisely what it is, a random famous person's thoughts on calculus.

Text: @quasicoherence Don't get me wrong; I'm not even of the position that people need to be reading hoary Marx tomes for insight on Communism (or economics or politics or whatever), much less Marx on math. I just found it an interesting curiosity.

Text: @quasicoherence Put another way: yes, I'm interested in other random famous people's thoughts on calculus (or other math) as well, if they've written them up.

Text: @quasicoherence Keynes on probability is interesting as well, for what it's worth (indeed, much more so, in terms of insight and contribution). But, uh, they don't have to all be economists…

Text: Non-vegetarians love to complain about Annoying Vegetarians, all the tiresome loudmouth vegetarians they've run into in life, etc. I, on the other hand, as a lifelong vegetarian, have an Annoying Aggressive Anti-Vegetarian encounter count in the stratosphere. Funny how it works.
