Text: @_cottoncrown_ I'm not sure I saw it on TV as a child, to be fair, because my attempts to look it up have primarily brought me to a Canadian commercial I might have watched online when I was 22.

Text: I don't think the average person should live as a talking head pundit who knows what the OMB is, much less strategizing savvy appointments to it. No such thing, just who's good or sucks in general. But our era's pretense is for everyone to play fantasy football political manager.

Text: @_brohan_ The uncle/aunt words depend on whether the relevant parent and their sibling are the same gender, and on their relative ages if they're the same gender, or on the gender of the parent and sibling if these differ.
