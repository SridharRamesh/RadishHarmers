Text: (In seriousness, watching the clip, I feel "Bernie Sanders slams restaurant…" is way overblowing it. Disappointingly mealy-mouthed he couldn't just say "Good, let's protest in every channel!", but it's really not quite what this headline paints it to be. https://t.co/HKZqF9rMOU)

Text: I generally wish to see the whole concept of "intellectual property" and copyright law dismantled, the world moved toward less such commodified property rights rather than more.

Text: I am remembering how I ended up w/o insurance in 2016.

I had signed up for insurance for the last few months of 2015 through the exchange site (on a special enrollment period) and confirmed with my insurance company as 2016 approached that it would auto-enroll for the next year.

Text: I didn't even qualify for a special enrollment period (the nominal date of loss of my insurance was at the start of 2016, not the three months into it when I was informed it didn't exist, so I no longer qualified for a loss of coverage special enrollment).

Text: The insurance company had actually never told the exchange some necessary info or form to re-register me for 2016 as on an exchange plan, etc.

At this point, my insurance was retroactively cancelled and my premiums refunded, but it was now too late for open enrollment.

Text: Of course, I can sign up directly with insurance companies instead of going through the exchange site at all (I probably have too much income from the first half of the year for discounted premiums anyway?), but who knows what further dangers lurk for when I move again soon?
