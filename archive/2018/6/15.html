<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Music is unbearable to listen to, with my favorite artists worst of the lot, naturally. After all, I spent so much time cheering myself up with it during the most painful periods in my life. The associations are too strong. I&#39;ve Ludovicoed myself out of the medium.</p></blockquote>

While you&#39;re here, check out...&quot; companion link. (But my tweet had better go viral. This is conditional endorsement.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I genuinely believe the solution to this sort of bullshit is that college should not have merit-based admission, or significantly selective admission at all. I hardly see why things should be set up this way, with this scarcity mindset for education. https://t.co/EIGkULGuRD</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Of course, people aren&#39;t genuinely chasing education, as such, but rather, credentials, whose zero-sum value comes from their gatekeeping. That&#39;s the system. (I&#39;m repeating points I&#39;ve already said, because I feel like repeating myself.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I used to love Douglas Adams, but haven&#39;t re-read him in years. But I&#39;d hate for it to turn out he&#39;s Bad. Like Python et al, I hope the way a bunch of nerdy dipshits enjoy him doesn&#39;t rule out how nerdy non-dipshits could enjoy him too. Anything good attracts a spectrum of fans.</p></blockquote>
