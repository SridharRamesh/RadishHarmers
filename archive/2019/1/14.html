<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How has no one done &quot;The Hoarse_ebooks&quot; yet? Well, perhaps it&#39;s for the best. Good luck deciphering this, archaeologists who have recovered this tweet and this tweet alone. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.</p></blockquote>
