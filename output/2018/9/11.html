Text: In classrooms all over, teachers engage in shockingly insensitive behavior, instructing students to disregard the order in which items are multiplied (indeed, drilling "(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab" and the like). So many disheartening examples of institutionalized Abelism.

Text: As I age, painful reminders of lost youth abound. For example, they've long since stopped carding me at the supermarket! Granted, I quit drinking years ago.

Text: @dannyburt33 (Though, to be clear, I actually do still quite like Norm qua comic, even while already noting in the original thread his stupidities.)
