<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@x1yeons You&#39;re watching edited footage where they messed with the speed for comedic effect. Of course it looks fake. When you take real videos and then make them fake, they look fake. https://t.co/fGNDPcBGWG</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@SmilingObject @brogadishu I&#39;m reminded of a West Wing line stuck in my head still. A salt of the Earth sap pouring out &quot;It should be hard. I like that it&#39;s hard. Putting your daughter through college, that&#39;s a man&#39;s job. A man&#39;s accomplishment.&quot;, as he stirringly requests only incremental tuition relief.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@edavidds @SmilingObject @brogadishu The world is currently set up around employment. It is rare for one to be able to live without it. Thus, currently, contingently, social structures and stigmas track this. Every study of this sort is tainted by this. It does not tell us what the world not set up this way is like.</p></blockquote>

Even in the past, people remembered the past.</p></blockquote>

Ah, I don&#39;t know. I just felt like remarking on the phenomenon where nitpick-threads are themselves often susceptible to nitpick, by the same uncharitable standards.</p></blockquote>
