Text: @pegobry You are angry that a politician should happen to think there are things that could be improved. What is the point of politicians if this is out of bounds?

Text: @pablum_man @flglmn Getting offended about "blind spot" is dumb. That's the sort of thing that would often annoy me. But it's no great crime to be a little dumb and silly in that way. Suggesting immigrants need to shut up or get the boot is a hundred times worse.

Text: The stigma furries suffer is terrible. There's nothing unnatural about being a furry. It's commonly observed in the animal kingdom.

Text: @QasimRashid Are people under the impression he died in the blast some other way than by suicide bombing? That it was some non-bomb blast that he non-suicide died in? What is being corrected here?

Text: I think it's fine for kids to read or not read The Odyssey or whatever other thing. It doesn't matter.

Text: It's silly to make a big deal about how The Odyssey is problematically unwoke whatever, but it's also silly to make a big deal about how kids are being denied access to the uniquely edifying insights of the classical canon whatever. Who cares? It doesn't matter.

Text: @htpyFiber I think that's potentially a good exercise, if you pose to the children that there might be a clever way to do it (instead of doing it like a time-wasting prank). I think it's something kids could figure out on their own if encouraged to do so, and that it would be fun to do so.

Text: I am disappointed to see everyone disparaging this. Many disabled people cannot dance for themselves and would benefit from having a robot dance for them.
