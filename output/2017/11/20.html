Text: @liftrss @dril Oh, I must've known that at one point, but completely forgot this was your alt! Anyway, sure, I'll give you the #ff endorsement, but don't expect to see a noticeable bump from it.

Text: Formerly @liftrs, but permabanned because Twitter is garbage. But not so garbage that you should quit instead of following them. But don't follow them until Friday. Got it?

Text: This is the image I mean. Can't find much information on "Flying Fish L.A.". Found one reference to "1987 iconic print by Catherine Koetter in the style of Roy Lichtenstein", but can't find much info on Koetter either. https://t.co/AwNQEBZJAO

Text: @leisurelefty Also, sincerely, Black Mirror is good. Subtlety is not universally valuable, and why not think about "What if phones but too much?", as the topic is reductively put. (Twitter's reflexive dismissal of any creative work in any way parodyable is one of its worst qualities.)

Text: @leisurelefty Of course, Twitter is particularly dismissive of works which explore the ways in which Twitter may not be good. (Ironic, considering how much Twitter itself makes this same self-deprecating point.)
