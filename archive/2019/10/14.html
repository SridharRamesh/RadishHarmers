<pre>I have accepted a position as ethnicity reviewer for a major coastal publication, a paper of record, a paper which, one might say, has &quot;all the news&quot; that&#39;s &quot;fit&quot; to &quot;print&quot;. Look forward to my rankings soon. Some may surprise you!</pre>

[700 comments about how this isn&#39;t a real apology, doesn&#39;t count, if you look closely at the details of the wording, and so on.]</pre>

<pre>@rogerbellin I would like to clarify that, for once, I was only using an ordinary English language word, and it is my followers who are bringing all the math jargon into it. This does not count against my personal No Math Jokes pledge.</pre>

<pre>The world&#39;s first globe, dating to the late 15th century. Its manufacturer is no longer known, having stamped only the initials &quot;C.C.&quot;. Europe is beautifully, impeccably detailed. There is also a hemispherically large blob marked &quot;India&quot;.</pre>

<pre>Columbus, you dolt! We were to go to India, for its wonderful spices. Black pepper! The mouth waters!
