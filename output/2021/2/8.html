Text: I first learnt the rules of football, what downs meant etc, from a family friend's manual for the SNES game Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose!, which featured an Acme Looniversity Football stage. I didn't own the video game and would not go on to play it for several years.

Text: I'm renewing my focus on a project that should be straightforward if I commit myself to actually doing it. It's not a comedy thing and most of you will not care about it at all. Once it's done, I'll feel freed to do whatever. Retweet my greatest hits in the meanwhile.
