Text: @kioskmage @rmbellovin @sqrtnegative1 @jcreed Oh, I erroneously blamed Twitter, heh. I'm not accustomed to defining non-ordered "archimedean fields". People call C an archimedean field?

Text: @rmbellovin @kioskmage @sqrtnegative1 @jcreed Ah, right, an archimedean valued field. Regardless, I think "Archimedean number" wouldn't really cause confusion, anymore than that there

Text: @rmbellovin @kioskmage @sqrtnegative1 @jcreed are both real numbers and other real-closed fields currently. And Archimedean numbers are more what Archimedes had more in mind.

Text: @jcreed @kioskmage @rmbellovin @sqrtnegative1 As do I. Which also gets rid of some of the weird "Real numbers have physical interpretation, which complex numbers don't" nonsense.

Text: @rmbellovin @jcreed @kioskmage @sqrtnegative1 So what? Who said we had to say "2 x 2 matrices"? The embedding of C into scaling-and-rotation operators is a perfect isomorphism.

Text: @jcreed @kioskmage @rmbellovin @sqrtnegative1 You're far gone if you've forgotten that most ppl are familiar w/ rotation but not w/ signal proc., even if they're the same in the end. :)

Text: @rmbellovin @jcreed @kioskmage @sqrtnegative1 Scaling-and-rotation operators have clear multiplicative inverses. That they're closed under addition is not obvious, but can be shown

Text: @rmbellovin @jcreed @kioskmage @sqrtnegative1 Scaling-and-rotation operators are just the one most ubiquitously of relevance to laypeople. I do not mean to deny the value of others.
