Text: @mcurryfelidae07 Rebecca Tuvel is very explicitly not a transphobe. She is very explicitly accepting of transgender people getting to live as they wish.

Text: @TespGames @WeMeantWell @ishaantharoor @michaelarria Then the point stands. In Britain, without money, you can get NHS level care. In the US, without money, you cannot.
