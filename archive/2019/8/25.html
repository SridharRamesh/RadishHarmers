<pre>Oh, apparently the theory is that they&#39;re specifically responding to posts that say &quot;fuck&quot; or &quot;fucking&quot;.</pre>

<pre>For what it&#39;s worth, using &quot;literally&quot; as a generic intensifier really makes my blood boil, too. It&#39;s truly a plague on the English language. I&#39;m really laid-back on usage peeves in general, but this one actually drives me insane. In fact, it&#39;s quite soul-crushing.</pre>

<pre>This would&#39;ve been a good post to quit Twitter forever with, but my pathological need to blather persists.</pre>

<pre>I bet some of the friends I knew whose deaths saddened me at the time would&#39;ve gone on to have bad politics and be frustrating on Facebook.</pre>

<pre>@Bookcaterpilla1 I know it&#39;s hard not having friends or family nearby. I also recently moved and have few friends in my new city yet, but one must hope that one can make new friends, instead of, like egg cells, having only a fixed and diminishing stock for life.</pre>
