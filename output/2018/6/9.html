Text: @Styl_oh The superstition I've grown convinced of, contra my earliest tweeting behavior, is that tweets must end with a period, or other punctuation mark as appropriate, to do well. No cutting characters in this way is permitted. If it's 281 with the period, better re-word something else.

Text: @Styl_oh Oh, this isn't some slam on your own tweet, I should say. This is genuinely the Twitter superstition I've convinced myself of. https://t.co/6qzmZk6TDP

Text: Diaspora desis are oft so fucking corny because they keep pretending to be something they're not. But perhaps among the reasons why they pretend to be something they're not is because there's some default sense that diaspora is a lesser identity than "authentic" native desi-hood.

Text: Diaspora desi isn't a lesser identity than subcontinental desi. It's just a different identity. It's fine. Not everything the former does differently from the latter is a mark against the former.

Text: Everyone hates everyone who thinks they're funny or entertaining (and understandably so; what narcissism!), but also, hey, entertainers have to come from somewhere, so as far as I'm concerned, take a stab at it if you like; it's fine by me. https://t.co/47HEpp8Hax

Text: I hear the voice noting "Day 15: supplies have run low, and the fuselage-improvised raft is increasingly unstable. I fear no help is coming. I envy those who died in the crash, spared…" as I put the conch shell to my ear, but until they give coordinates, there's little I can do.

Text: No, don't do it! Take heart: see how upset folks would be if you died (if you've become well-accomplished)? Your life is far from meaningless and without impact (presuming you are successful and acclaimed).

Text: Re-reading my HS yearbook. Huh, I didn't remember quite how many "Oh god, you better change a lot, and change fast!! Anyway, have a great summer and…" messages were in here. Bittersweet, the goals we let lapse. Well, one of these days I'll get around to having that great summer.

Text: @MurrayOverboard @shitshowdotinfo As far as I'm concerned, a "career" is what others sometimes call a "carelord".
