Text: Everything's tribal. Obviously, this crowd wouldn't take or even countenance this position on the nature of comedy in myriad other cases (and rightfully so, in those myriad other cases). But the alliances have aligned up differently on this one.

Text: At all times, I should be either productive or sleeping. I can tilt the balance between the two however I like, that's fine, but to spend so much time awake yet doing nothing, as I do? Madness. Foolishness. May posting this make me actually internalize its lesson.

Text: Focusing as I fall asleep on the plot beats I've outlined for the dream I would like to have tonight. Compelling dramedy with A- and B-stories linking up neatly at end. But some sound intervenes, and suddenly I'm stuck helping my dead grandpa solve the Riddle of the Inca instead.

Text: @annakhachiyan @martymacmarty I'm not dunking on Anna qua Anna, just on this particular attitude about what comedy is for, currently ubiquitous. Anna sometimes says things I basically agree with and sometimes says things I think are dumb. In this case, I do think there's a hypocrisy in play worth considering.
