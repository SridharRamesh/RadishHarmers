<pre>I hate the stereotype that Indian food gives people diarrhea. The unsanitary conditions of India&#39;s drinking water infrastructure give people diarrhea. Indian food is great.</pre>

People try things, some fall flat, de gustibus. The actual annoyance here is similar to this. https://t.co/9dtPKPmFrO</pre>
