Text: Alright, here's a compromise. We all get one free moment of accidental Zoom nudity at work, no questions asked. Every week, we'd all watch the nudity of whichever colleague's turn it is, and after that learning experience, they're on zero tolerance and have to be more careful.

Text: I'll be a bit reductively contrarian. This just indicates this kind of talk is broadly popular right now. If slogans about seizing the means of production became the broadly popular thing, the CIA would put those in their ads. That's how ads work.

Text: I'm as bad as any liberal, as my interest in politics has plummeted. It spiked as everyone got into politics 24/7 after 2016, and now it's crashed back down. I still have all the correct opinions but I don't care anymore. I prefer to spend time thinking about my actual interests.
