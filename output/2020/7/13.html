Text: @truerphilosophy This is the thing I mainly am asking for people to check whether they can explain: Why can't a prime divide a product of other primes? Why is it that if you take two values which aren't divisible by prime p, and you multiply them, the result can't be divisible by p either?

Text: If we started with 15, we'd get the repeating pattern of last digits 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, … .

Every second multiple of 15 ends in a 0.

If we started with 20, we'd get the repeating pattern 0, 0, 0, … . Every "one-th" multiple of 20 ends in a 0. They all do, since 20 itself does.

Text: It's a repeating pattern, because it keeps doing the same thing (adding 4, ignoring carries), and has to eventually hit a digit it hit before (there's only so many digits, it can't hit new ones forever), at which point it has to continue in the same way it continued before.

Well, duh, any tenth multiple of anything ends in 0. But sometimes we multiples ending in 0 more frequently than that, and sometimes not.

Text: @ambignostic The important thing is recognizing that there are actual stories and explanations and reasoning in all of these, conceptual things that could actually be interesting, not just algorithms for calculation to be memorized and drilled in robotic drudgery.

Text: @HelingCrew @Duncan31503119 Now we do have them, so people can now study with them. A calculator doesn't hinder your learning, it helps it. There was a point in time when pen and paper didn't exist either, but we don't demand students first go through all their classes not using them, to pay their dues.

Text: @eric_time No one ever believes me when I say this, but the fact that "6 x 6 = 36" isn't actually fundamental to understanding multiplication. Yes, 6 x 6 = three tens and another six. It also equals five sevens and one left over. Why is it so important to memorize the one and not the other?

Text: @eric_time Neither is actually necessary to memorize, to understand multiplication. 9 x 7 is six tens and three leftover, yes, but it's also five elevens and an eight leftover. Plenty of people understand multiplication just fine without bothering drilling on memorizing the latter, though.

Text: @eric_time These sort of digit calculations are only relevant when they're relevant. They don't in themselves shed light on anything. Whether they're relevant depends on what one is doing. They don't have to be preemptively done to understand the meaning of multiplication at all.

Text: @eric_time But, every child can produce these results slowly by hand whether or not they've memorized them, and can also produce them quickly by calculator. So there's no problem. The child understood all the concepts there were to understand, and the calculator took care of speed concerns.

Text: @Surreal_Cynic They certainly added depth to their understanding. I don't dispute that! Perhaps the best addition was understanding which other contexts had unique prime factorization by the same argument (e.g., polynomials over fields, or Gaussian integers) and which didn't.

Text: @eduardog3000 Take a pair of whole numbers. It may be that they are both multiples of some common divisor. Choose a common divisor and divide it out from both of them. It may be that they still have a common divisor. Choose a common divisor and divide it out from both of them.

Text: @eduardog3000 Keep going in this way till there's no common divisor you can choose.

Along the way, you made various choices. Yet, it turns out, for any pair of numbers you start with, no matter what choices you make along the way, you will end up at the same result in the end.

Why is this?

Text: @eduardog3000 That's the puzzle. This is not obvious. Lots of things don't work this way. Lots of games are such that, by making different choices, you can end up at different stopping points. Why does this game have the special property that you always end up at the same stopping point?

Text: @eduardog3000 Another way of presenting the non-obvious thing the discussion of number pairs was meant to highlight is this: If you pick two whole numbers and list out their common divisors, you'll find that the largest one is always divisible by all the other ones.
