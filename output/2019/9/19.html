Text: Seeing a lot of misguided cancellations of Big Mouth on the timeline. Big Mouth is great-to-fine. Yeah, it's about reflecting on the creators' experiences of puberty; we all went through puberty, it's fine.

Text: Obviously, it's fine for anyone to find anything not to their taste. If you personally don't find it funny, I don't care to argue in vain over that. I'm only pushing back on the idea I keep seeing that there's something ethically sketchy to the premise of the show.

Text: @SaschaSo70s There are various criticisms, but one common one is that it sexualizes minors unacceptably.

Text: I will join in on the criticisms that the art style isn't very appealing or impressive, alas. But I enjoyed the show regardless.

Text: Highly problematic of me to be good at math, as an Asian person. Perpetuating constrictive stereotypes; hardly breaking color lines. I vow to do better and be worse.
