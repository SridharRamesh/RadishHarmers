<pre>However, in this case, given the frustration of writing on Twitter with its character count restrictions, lack of editing, etc, I will, with a sigh, outline a quick, lazy explanation first, for those whose patience is limited. I&#39;ll give a better discussion later.</pre>

<pre>One dilemma with math is that often one can give a very quick explanation to a particular question, vs. a slightly slower explanation for the one particular question, that builds up more machinery that makes further questions much easier to understand. I always prefer the latter.</pre>

<pre>But first go ahead, see for yourself that it works this way, thinking about cubes and pyramids and all the example shapes above and whatever else you can think about. Vertices - edges + faces always equals 2, on anything ball-like.</pre>

<pre>Don&#39;t worry, I will explain why this V - E + F = 2 (called &quot;Euler&#39;s formula&quot;, though a dozen other things are also called that) holds later in this thread.

This will be the most enlightening part of the story, that generalizes in many directions to other wonderful math.</pre>

<pre>There&#39;s a certain formula that always holds whenever you make a ball out of faces (or tiles, or regions, or whatever you want to call them). 

Specifically, the number of vertices (aka, corners, points, â€¦) - the number of edges + the number of faces will always equal 2.</pre>

<pre>The explanation comes in two parts.

First, let&#39;s introduce another mystery:</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>Once we have this formula, it&#39;s not hard to see why we need twelve 5-sided faces, if we&#39;re going to tile a ball with 6- and 5-sided faces, three meeting at each vertex. Indeed, many readers who were already familiar with the above formula saw it for themselves.</pre>

<hr>

</p>
<p>
<pre>It&#39;s worth my emphasizing, nothing in this depends on the angles or sizes or even straightness of the faces. Make them all kinds of squashed and squiggly, but this formula will still hold. It&#39;s purely a matter of considering the structure of how the faces connect to each other.</pre>

<p>
<pre>This means, if we have H hexagons and 5 pentagons, the number of vertices is (6H + 5P)/3, the number of edges is (6H + 5P)/2, and the number of faces is just H + P. So our formula tells us (6H + 5P)/3 - (6H + 5P)/2 + H + P = 2.</pre>

<p>
<pre>Each hexagon has 6 vertices and 6 edges. Each pentagon has 5 vertices and 5 edges. Each edge touches 2 of these, and we&#39;re also supposing for now that each vertex touches 3 of these.</pre>

But for now, the quick and dirty explanation is this.</pre>

<pre>The fact that the H terms cancel out is why we can build large sheets of as many hexagons as we want, without it making any difference to anything else.</pre>

<pre>If you keep merging faces by erasing edges, and merging edges by erasing useless vertices, eventually, you run out of things you can merge or erase in this way.</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>Similarly, if you see a vertex connecting exactly two edges and nothing else, you can erase the vertex, and merge the two edges into one, bringing V and E each down by one, without affecting V - E + F.</pre>

<hr>

</p>
<p>
<pre>When you see an edge between two different faces, you can erase it. This gets rid of an edge, and also turns two faces into one. So E goes down by 1 and F goes down by 1, but since they have opposite sign in our formula, this keeps V - E + F the same. It&#39;s unaffected.</pre>

<pre>There are much better ways to think about Euler&#39;s formula, and there is much more to say about other math it connects to, but I will have to save that for later.

<pre>But also, now V - E + F = 2 clearly, and since it never changes, it must&#39;ve been 2 to begin with.

That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the quick and dirty explanation, which I&#39;ve lazily provided without pictures.</pre>

<pre>And if, in the throes of madness, you then knock out that edge, the result is one vertex, no edges, and just one big face comprising the whole ball. Well, now, there&#39;s really nothing left to do.</pre>

<p>
<pre>Of course, many things in nature do come in cubes, or use triangles, etc. But basically no viruses make capsids in this way. It&#39;s been theorized that this has to do with the superior efficiency of pentagonal faces in absorbing compression stress, vs. fewer-sided faces.</pre>

<pre>Incidentally, the same reasoning says that instead of 12/(6 - 5) = 12 pentagons, we could&#39;ve used 12/(6 - 4) = 6 four-sided faces, or 12/(6 - 3) = 4 triangles. Or even 12/(6 - 2) = 3 two-sided faces! So why is it pentagons that so many viruses settled on using?</pre>

Then, on each turn, you&#39;re allowed to either draw a new edge between two vertices you&#39;ve already drawn, or draw a new edge between one vertex you&#39;ve already drawn and one new vertex.</pre>
