Text: @zlingman Cucumber with nachos sounds good to me. Sincerely. Why is everyone online always so angrily averse to anyone ever trying anything new or non-traditional with food?

Each traditional dish was new once, too. They didn't spring forth fully formed from Zeus's forehead.

Text: @niralshah Yeah. Like, moral onus or not, it is the practical onus. Convince and you get change; don't convince and, sadly, unfairly even, but tautologically nonetheless, you will not.

Text: @typicaldolt @zlingman Why couldn't I enjoy it? (Alright, it's not "nachos", if you insist. It's some other thing then. Well, I enjoy many foods that aren't nachos; what's one more?)

Text: @Sturgeons_Law Sure, sure, and I like my pongal from time to time. But let's be honest: Columbus, though everyone lambasts him as some idiot who didn't even get the spices he went out looking for, ended up finding way better ones.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law Disagree in that you like all these other spices (which, of course, I also enjoy and use and am being somewhat facetious in dismissing the significance of) or in that you furthermore dislike cinnamon (which would be surprising, but hey, everyone's entitled to their own tastes…)?

Text: Thinking about death, like I'm going to discover some new insight on it, something new to say, 5000 years into history. Still, others in our lives end, and the mind demands time to "process", ritually relearning brute facts already known in childhood: "Everyone dies; some early".
