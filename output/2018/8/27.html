Text: I've been learning a lot over the past few days, facts I was not previously aware of. I now know Arabs are not simply the offspring of one white and one black parent (what I had assumed to be "the cheat code to unlock the third race"), and have several people to apologize to.

Text: When the bike accident ripped open my left leg, I at least took advantage of the silver lining opportunity, performing bespoke divination by reading bones. As I inspected the tibia closely, I found printed in plain English, "Outlook hazy. Consult other leg."
