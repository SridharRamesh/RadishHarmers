Text: @SimonCharlow SKI actually has some naturality to it, it arises very naturally in turning the lambda calculus into combinators. And similarly for thinking of B, C, W, etc, as you say. I'm not quite taken with putting everything into combinator terms but it can at least be done with naturality.

Text: @SimonCharlow But that's all way better than stuff like that linked Wolfram supercombinator, or sorry to say, your advisor's super combinator. All the single combinator systems really have no naturality at all. Even the trick of turning I into S K anything pushes us rather into trick-land.

Text: @SimonCharlow Well, tricks are fun sometimes, I'm not against having some fun. That's all Iota/Jot/Zot are meant to be, I gather, some Brainfuck-like fun. But Wolfram, I think, ascribes these code golf searches rather more significance, in a rather more misguided way.

Text: @littmath The order of A has to divide p^k, thus be a power of p. By the Frobenius endomorphism, the condition that A^{p^k} = 1 is the same as (A - 1)^{p^k} = 0. So the question is, what's the maximum power-of-p nilpotence order we can have for an operator on n-dimensional space?
