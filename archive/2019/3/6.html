<pre>Proud of myself when I&#39;m super garrulous, and also proud of myself when I sit back quietly, yielding to others to instead dominate the oxygen in the room. Either way, I&#39;m displaying my fine skills of discernment. I&#39;m constantly making the correct decisions others screw up.</pre>

<pre>If I said something weird to you at a bar: it&#39;s noisy and my hearing is bad and half the time I&#39;m just guessing at what I&#39;m replying to. 

If I said something weird to you not at a bar: I was distracted, still trying to figure out what someone said to me at a bar the other night.</pre>

<pre>Sitting alone in my room, late at night, I begin to worry. Do I have any redeeming values at all? Am I any good? I take a quick vote, so I can know for sure. 1 For, 0 Against. Unanimous as always. Phew. I continue the evening, spring in my step, smiling with my mandate.</pre>

<pre>@kathbarbadoro Definitely a cryptoracist policy, barely crypto, but also, race notwithstanding, anyone who wants dreadlocks or any other hairstyle should be able to w/o job worries. Whites with dreads are fine, in the grand scheme; bosses who itch to control others&#39; hair are the awful ones.</pre>

<pre>@kathbarbadoro I feel like this is saying whites who partake of traditionally nonwhite fashions are doing something unethical, in a way I wouldn&#39;t agree with. I feel like even if no white ever chose to wear dreads, bosses who want to discriminate would go right on doing so with same legal ease.</pre>

<pre>So much crudity from me lately. Could raise charges of edgelordery. I need to take time to focus on sweet jokes, little logic puzzles, stuff I could show my parents. Must make sure it&#39;s all clever, not mere frisson. Sometimes that comes in such package, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.</pre>
