Text: Somebody made something up out of whole cloth, it caught on, and now, Richard Gere is forever denied the otherwise universal joy of finding gerbils cute. They have been tainted for him for life.

Text: Perhaps he even always wanted one as a pet. But once he reaches adulthood, some malicious capricious wind comes, out of the fucking blue, completely unpredictable, and knocks his childhood aspirations into a rubbish bin marked "Nope. You can't have this now.".

Text: @onfim100mL I don't know. I was curious about this too. (You are in exactly the same boat I was in, several hours ago). I can't find anyone else having ever discussed it, but I guess he's just one of the many-fold diverse possibilities in the world.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law @BagelSmalls Eh, I can imagine her parents going either way; some of course are as you say, but, e.g., my own parents match the same "UC &amp; likely not poor Indian Hindu" description and my mom had a very, very hard time with my sister marrying a white man. "Immigrant insecurity" is correct.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law @BagelSmalls So I can see it genuinely upsetting this author's parents, but it's still a corny, stupid thing she's saying. As you note, it's... not that unusual for diaspora Indian women to marry white guys, despite parents.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law @BagelSmalls And your "They'd probably object more to her marrying an Indian Dalit Muslim" observation is spot on, in its sad irony.

Text: The torus as donut isn't really a great visualization of S^1 x S^1; it makes the most basic operation (swapping the two coordinates) not even obviously present. Better to think in terms of 4-d embedding of the circle^2, or, keeping dimensions down, look at (R/Z)^2 = R^2/Z^2.

Text: Everything topologically interesting about the torus is much better visualized without using the donut. (Apart, of course, from the one fact "It can be realized as a donut"…)

Text: @FrankieG_Baby Haha. I mean, let me put this in accessible terminology: if you want to think about toroidal topology, think about Asteroids-world: a square with wraparound behavior. This makes it obvious that you can do things like flip the coordinates, something not obvious looking at a donut.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby 4d is certainly less accessible visualization, but 2d is more accessible. In general, a continuous function on a torus is the same as a continuous function on Asteroids-world, which is to say, on a plane, repeating periodically both horizontally and vertically.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby And for most of the math that is important about this space, thinking about Asteroids-world is a clearer perspective than thinking about a donut.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby Well, that and all the pi(e) stuff, I suppose. Plus all the coffee mug comparisons to go with the donut. At this point, I probably hear more about food in pop math than about food in other contexts.

Text: @brocialistmeme Raphael as the cool one? This is extremely non-canonical of you to say.

But I present to you, the cool one. He was a big part of the video (watch it here https://t.co/u0WGjj34Ew), but just omitted from the cover for some reason? https://t.co/VYdR0fdzjl
