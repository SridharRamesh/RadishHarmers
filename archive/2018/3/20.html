<pre>Perhaps he even always wanted one as a pet. But once he reaches adulthood, some malicious capricious wind comes, out of the fucking blue, completely unpredictable, and knocks his childhood aspirations into a rubbish bin marked &quot;Nope. You can&#39;t have this now.&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@onfim100mL I don&#39;t know. I was curious about this too. (You are in exactly the same boat I was in, several hours ago). I can&#39;t find anyone else having ever discussed it, but I guess he&#39;s just one of the many-fold diverse possibilities in the world.</pre>

<pre>@Sturgeons_Law @BagelSmalls Eh, I can imagine her parents going either way; some of course are as you say, but, e.g., my own parents match the same &quot;UC &amp;amp; likely not poor Indian Hindu&quot; description and my mom had a very, very hard time with my sister marrying a white man. &quot;Immigrant insecurity&quot; is correct.</pre>

<pre>@Sturgeons_Law @BagelSmalls So I can see it genuinely upsetting this author&#39;s parents, but it&#39;s still a corny, stupid thing she&#39;s saying. As you note, it&#39;s... not that unusual for diaspora Indian women to marry white guys, despite parents.</pre>

<pre>The torus as donut isn&#39;t really a great visualization of S^1 x S^1; it makes the most basic operation (swapping the two coordinates) not even obviously present. Better to think in terms of 4-d embedding of the circle^2, or, keeping dimensions down, look at (R/Z)^2 = R^2/Z^2.</pre>

<pre>Everything topologically interesting about the torus is much better visualized without using the donut. (Apart, of course, from the one fact &quot;It can be realized as a donut&quot;…)</pre>

<p>
<pre>@FrankieG_Baby Haha. I mean, let me put this in accessible terminology: if you want to think about toroidal topology, think about Asteroids-world: a square with wraparound behavior. This makes it obvious that you can do things like flip the coordinates, something not obvious looking at a donut.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@FrankieG_Baby 4d is certainly less accessible visualization, but 2d is more accessible. In general, a continuous function on a torus is the same as a continuous function on Asteroids-world, which is to say, on a plane, repeating periodically both horizontally and vertically.</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby And for most of the math that is important about this space, thinking about Asteroids-world is a clearer perspective than thinking about a donut.</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby Well, that and all the pi(e) stuff, I suppose. Plus all the coffee mug comparisons to go with the donut. At this point, I probably hear more about food in pop math than about food in other contexts.</pre>

<pre>@brocialistmeme Raphael as the cool one? This is extremely non-canonical of you to say.

But I present to you, the cool one. He was a big part of the video (watch it here https://t.co/u0WGjj34Ew), but just omitted from the cover for some reason? https://t.co/VYdR0fdzjl</pre>
