Text: @radical_ideals @yungneocon For what it's worth, though it's of course wonderful to understand the full math of sphere volumes, if one just wants to understand why the inner-sphere-to-outer-box volume ratio approaches zero for large dimensions, the explanation in that Wikipedia article is overkill.

Text: @radical_ideals @yungneocon The volume-ratio for any figure to its enclosing box is upper-bounded by the corresponding ratio for any cross-section of it. Indeed, it's upper-bounded by the product of the corresponding ratios for cross-sections which live in separate orthogonal dimensions.

Text: @radical_ideals @yungneocon E.g., the volume of the Earth has to be less than than the length of the polar axis times the area of the perpendicular equatorial disk, since the Earth fits into the cylinder of all points which project onto those same cross-sections.

Text: @radical_ideals @yungneocon But every cross-section of a high-dimensional sphere is just some lower-dimensional sphere. In this way, we see that if f(n) is the n-dimensional unit sphere volume, f(a + b) ≤ f(a) f(b). [Our argument about the Earth was the special case of this for f(1 + 2) ≤ f(1) f(2)].

Text: @radical_ideals @yungneocon Among other things, this tells us that f(2n) ≤ f(2)^n. And since f(2) &lt; 1, we see that f shrinks at least exponentially fast towards zero.

FIN.

Text: @rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon Hm? This ratio is (1 - 1/sqrt(n))^n. This doesn't approach 1 as n increases; it approaches 0.

Text: @rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon You're in luck now. Suppose our sphere is centered at the origin with radius 1, and the enclosing cube consists of those points whose coordinates do not exceed 1 in magnitude:

Text: @rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon Without loss of generality, we can restrict our attention to points with positive coordinates, as all the ratios will be the same here as in any other "quadrant"; thus, we skip all the 2^n business.

Text: @rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon The region of interest is those points whose coordinates average to at least as high a value as the average of the coordinates at the tangent point on the sphere, where all the coordinates are 1/sqrt(n).

Text: @rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon But by the law of large numbers, as n gets large, nearly 100% of the volume is contained at points whose coordinates average to about 1/2, which is larger than 1/sqrt(n). Thus, asymptotically 100% of the "quadrant" is on the other side of the tangent plane from the sphere. QED.

Text: @rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon Basically, what's happening here is that, contra low-dimensional intuition, in larger dimensions, the center of each "quadrant" is itself already outside the sphere. Its coordinates are all 1/2, so it has distance sqrt(n)/2 from the origin, which exceeds 1 once n exceeds 4.

Text: @rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon But the bulk of the volume of each "quadrant" (asymptotically 100%) is on the same side and within epsilon of the same distance from the desired tangent plane as that center.

Text: @rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon Given N independent values uniformly between -1 and 1, in the large N limit, almost certainly, the mean of their absolute values is within epsilon of 1/2. But their root mean square has to be at least as large as this mean (squaring is a "convex" function).

Text: @rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon So almost certainly their root mean square is nearly 1/2. But to count as "in the sphere", the sum of their squares has to be under 1, which means their mean square has to be under 1/n, which means their root mean square has to be under 1/sqrt(n). As 1/2 exceeds 1/sqrt(n), QED.

Text: @rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon Also, actually, the mean vs. root mean square inequality is overkill here. We know very specifically the distribution of each coordinates' square, which has a mean value of 1/3. So almost certainly the mean of these squares is very nearly 1/3, which exceeds the sphere limit 1/n.

Text: @rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon So, in other words, given an n-dimensional cube, for large n, almost all of its volume is very nearly 1/sqrt(3) times as far away from its center as its corners are.
