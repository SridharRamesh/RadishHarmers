<pre>I used to make sure never to kill insects or bugs; only ever to carefully capture them and release them outside. Now, I&#39;m lazier. I don&#39;t know that I can justify this. I bare my sins publicly and hope for redemption. (But I bare them in a language only humans understand.)</pre>

<pre>Geoffrey, no, you sweet naif. What you mean to say is something like that no person is better than another; I&#39;m with you on that. But those things you are describing? They include some very significant ways in which some jobs are better than others! https://t.co/an1mv4f961</pre>

<pre>@sethiankit This kind of carping (from the prescriptivists; and about &quot;chai tea&quot; and such as well) always struck me as myopic. Do people not say &quot;pita bread&quot; and such? Is not the &quot;pepper&quot; in &quot;chili pepper&quot; redundant? It&#39;s fine. It all totally fine.</pre>

<pre>Keep it simple: Build a strong universal welfare state, and just tax the wealthy because they&#39;re wealthy. Don&#39;t bother linking tax levels to minutiae of formal employer-employee relations; isn&#39;t that the kind of process that got us our employer-linked healthcare boondoggle?</pre>

<pre>The BEZOS Act would explicitly incentivize corporations to push for slashing the quantity and quality of benefits provided by the welfare state (even moreso than in the current regime). Seems a myopic framing to adopt.</pre>
