Text: I'll probably never have kids, at this point. I don't have the energy. It takes nine months to have a baby. You have to have sex for nine months straight.

Text: History teaches us war is hell, except on three occasions. There were three good wars, we all agree, and each new war has a chance at being Good War 4. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

Text: I am trying to break into acting by being a seat-filler at the Academy Awards. Not for networking opportunities; god no,  I wouldn't bother anyone. Just for the experience, to develop the skill of sitting the right way, the way our finest actors would. Or convincingly seeming to.

Text: If I were Newton inventing the laws of physics, I'd have snuck in one where I have to be kept happy and healthy at all times. Absolutely ruinous oversight, to leave the universe unconstrained so. Boneheaded blunder from the dead virgin.

Text: Quibbling over the precise semantic boundaries of 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒, as though it weren't the greatest mistake in civilization's and lexicography's history to have decided 𝑘𝑖𝑙𝑙 and 𝑚𝑢𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 have a rectangle : square relationship.

Text: Paleolithic jobs were just trying random things all day, to figure everything out. What's food, what's poison, should we put food in fire, what happens if we churn milk, what happens if we pursue 1000 dead ends? A man could support a wife and two kids on the salary as a trier.

Text: They say chomos have it bad in prison, but that's nothing compared to how some other classes of criminals are treated. The infamous Prisoner Killer did not fare long in lockup before being viciously killed by prisoners, who loathed him for his crime of horrific prisoner-killing.
