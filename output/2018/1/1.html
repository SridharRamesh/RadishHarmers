Text: I think maybe I'd be less fixated on this thing if it hadn't happened 5 seconds from the front door of the apartment I've lived in for 11 years and always considered a "safe area".

(Or, I dunno, it's been less than 48 hours, so maybe I hardly need apologize for being "fixated".)

And I don't mind joking about it or whatever. It's what I've been doing too, though moreso IRL than on here, for whatever reason.

Text: What does it look like I do for a living?

Up through recently, if you said "Nothing, with increasing worry...", you'd be correct. But in a week I start an exciting gig, a job that's a far better match for my skills and interests than I thought likely to come my way anytime soon!

Text: @Styl_oh It turns out, they let just anyone wear suits or blazers if they like.

But it's true I did used to do a fairly privileged "something" before I did nothing, though that "something" (which I hated) was very much not into dressing up; that would've stuck out like a sore thumb.

Text: @Styl_oh It's so alien to me, the cruelty and lack of empathy involved, though I can sort of get it when I remember all the bizarrely shitty things I did to other people when I was adolescent, being a dick or a bully or so on myself at times. Nothing nearly so horrible, of course.

Text: @sigfpe @marx_knopfler Yeah, and I suppose the Golden Ratio must also come up indirectly in the context of icosahedra found in nature via icosahedral viruses, but this isn't really Golden Spiral-type stuff as people seem to ordinarily think naturally ubiquitous or somehow aesthetically "perfect".
