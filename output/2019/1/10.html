Text: @funnierhandle I've made the mistake of not clarifying my intention on a sincerity/irony scale here, and I suspect I'm getting Likes for very different interpretations, but you must RT this very carefully; there is but one interpretation your race is permitted to appreciate. Happy hermeneutics!

Please listen to the song "Common People" by Pulp. Pay particular attention to the line "Stupid things you do because you think poor is cool". That's you, losers!

Text: Representation's nice, I get the push, but the stuff folks fixate on, little of it scratches my itch. Most of us don't have superpowers with our entire lives set up for success and everything handed to us as The Chosen One. That's not a kind of person I strongly empathize with.

Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

I then go look up Bond women to masturbate to on my own time. I imagine some of them as Indian too.

Text: Because they're completely fictional, I've been imagining James Bond as Indian all along anyway. I do the replacement in my mind's eye; no one can stop me. I've had to rejigger parts of the plots as well, but that's ok; they were shitty to begin with. I keep the cars and music.

Text: @sodburger @EyePatchGuy @alexandraknew @imisspoundsigns What's written isn't an equation (in that there's no = anywhere), but I guess a name for things made up of variables, adding, multiplying, and dividing is "rational expressions", and you might call setting two of them equal a "rational equation".

Text: @EyePatchGuy @alexandraknew I'm all for no one being forced to study math if they aren't keen on it, but it is bizarre to me to imagine a Chemistry class with no math in it, not even of the "this / that = something else / another thing" kind. That kind of math seems pretty naturally ubiquitous in Chemistry.
