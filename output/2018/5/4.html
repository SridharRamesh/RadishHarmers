Text: @doppelson Kenilworth! Oh, this makes more sense now. School rivalry or something. I thought it was a guy shitting on his own district's school field. I'm sort of sad now that it isn't. That story tickled me more.

Text: @bradisterrific "Walked into Justin at a cafe, to my shock, as he moved away a year ago. Got angry at his rudeness when he didn't react to me at all! Eventually, it turned out, he wasn't Justin; he was Justin's twin! Didn't even know he had one; it was pretty funny…" is about the right length.

I must admit, you are clearly correct and we've all misinterpreted this video.

But that just takes this guy from "tragically shy, and hateful about its consequences" to "purely hateful".

Text: @theebonycyborg I'm both capable of reading my morality a little between the lines, and capable of getting my morality from sources other than fictional comedy that happens to have characters do bad things sometimes. Must the media allowed available to me be hobbled for others' babyproofing?
