Text: Jesus Christ, you simpletons, it's just based on the angle you view it, whether it's a giraffe or a beluga. It's like those duck/rabbit or old lady/young lady drawings.

Text: (Principia Mathematica sucks, by the way. There's really no point in reading it except as a historical artifact. If you love reading assembly code on architectures ill-suited to directly representing the program of interest, this is the three-volume book for you.)

Text: @quasicoherence There's this big lie that math is done in ZFC, and that's not true if you look at mathematical practice. Math is done with what rules are directly relevant, and webs of connections are observed. There's no such thing as its assembly code. Only certain logicians care about ZFC.

Text: @quasicoherence Math from the 1800s carries over to the present, even though it wasn't formulated in ZF, and that's because it had nothing to do with ZF. It wasn't just some pre-formal inchoate attempt to write a proof only made proper within ZF. It was its own thing and lives on its own terms.
