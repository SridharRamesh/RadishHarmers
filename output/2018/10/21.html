Text: RT @RadishHarmers: Hm, maybe. It's possible. But I have some skepticism it's hard to shake. https://t.co/MCaVPnGMLd

Text: Another productive week directing all my energy into day-to-day chores, never getting to the part where I progress on long-term goals. Another productive week paying off interest, wisely refraining from making a dent in the principal.

Text: RT @RadishHarmers: What glib myopia, to reduce all questions of morality to mere calculations of effect on GDP.

This ignores overseas inve‚Ä¶

Text: Broadcast networks don't show traditional TV static (the classic "snow") anymore because modern audiences no longer appreciate black-and-white films.

Text: Proof: Recursively define K(Œ±) as F( { K(Œ≤) | Œ≤ &lt; Œ± } ), for each ordinal Œ±. This yields a monotonic map from ordinals into X, which cannot remain forever injective (its range has some order type, and beyond that it must stabilize).

Text: Cleaner presentation:

Theorem: Let X be a partially ordered set, and F : ùí´(X) ‚Üí X a monotonic function (with ùí´(X) ordered by ‚äÜ). This cannot be strictly monotonic (there must be A ‚äÇ B such that F(A) = F(B)).

Text: Note: No subquotient of Y can be in bijection with the reals either, as convergent Y-indexed collections induce convergent collections indexed by any subquotient of Y (simply dropping unused terms, and adding together terms in the same equivalence class).

Text: Proof: We get a strictly monotonic map from ùí´(Y) to reals by sending each subset of Y to the sum of the correspondingly indexed terms of our convergent collection. Therefore, by our above theorem, the reals are not in bijection with Y.

Text: Corollary: Let Y be such that there is a Y-indexed collection of strictly positive reals with convergent sum. Then the reals are not in bijection with Y.

Text: In particular, as there famously ARE many natural-indexed collections of strictly positive reals with convergent sum, we may conclude that the reals are uncountable.

QED (again).

Text: In other words, for any partial function from Y to reals, there is some real not in its range, which our theorem's proof explicitly constructs. In this sense, the cardinality of the reals is greater than that of Y.

Text: @jcreed No. If the sum (of a bunch of positive reals) converges to S, there is at most one term of size S or greater, at most 2 terms of size S/2 or greater, at most 3 of size S/3 or greater, etc. This means there can only be countably many terms.
