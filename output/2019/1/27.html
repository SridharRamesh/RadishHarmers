Text: @bridgietherease Oh, wow. I hadn't been aware of this concept before, but I'm wowed. (I'm definitely not going to have a death poem ready to go.

Text: RIP, Ted "Crocodile" Bundy. Your methods were unorthodox, but we'll all now never forget the difference between improper and proper knives. You were a credit to your profession, serial knife salesman.

Text: In the year 2050, all "For Your Consideration" campaigns will be waged exclusively via battling observations of ways in which the competition is problematic. Best Director will be awarded based on who engaged in the least harassment. The winners will generally not be filmmakers.
