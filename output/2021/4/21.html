Text: Every movement has some stupid people, because stupidity is the norm. Some nobody being stupid hardly discredits the big picture, as the right-wing narrative seeks to paint.

That all said, it's quite funny how the energy left the crowd at "We don't want your fucking taqueria". https://t.co/RT3EC7yxAG

Text: @black_ops_post I think the way people frame and direct energy on gentrification is often hopelessly misguided and this is an example of that. A Mexican family owning a taqueria is fine and some white people eating tacos in Brooklyn is also fine. Neither of those have done something wrong.

Text: @black_ops_post These guys aren't the landlords. I am willing to change my mind if it turns out these motley taco eaters are a consortium of landlords. But frankly, I'll eat my hat if the guy yelling at them has been in Brooklyn much longer than the restaurant.

Text: My parents have decided to have an open family. I will remain their primary but they will be loving other children as well. It's hard for me not to feel wounded by this realization that I could not satisfy their needs.
