Text: When Kamala Harris grandstanded against Joe Biden in proud support of busing, it was due to her long-standing commitment to the concept of going back and forth between distant positions. https://t.co/Km2rnAlDCs

Text: Pummeled by seismic waves, Los Angeles lies in ruins. The entertainment industry needs to rebuild, desperately replacing the talent lost to earthen mass graves. Now is my chance.

Text: Holiday relevance bump. Take advantage of your leisurely day off work, kick your feet up, and watch a sketch about the American Revolution, as is our national tradition. Look, you indolent lot, I made it so you don't even have to click to another site anymore. https://t.co/GB6Ms3lOHr

Text: @swissidealism Yours is eternal. Mine was only in response to a flash-in-the-pan George Ciccariello-Maher post, which you may not remember or ever have been aware of.

Text: @swissidealism Precedence is precedence, regardless of deletion; would we deny Diogenes or Timon their due, simply for losing their works? The priority is yours, and I will acknowledge it hereout.

Text: To be clear, I didn't write this, or have any part in it other than correctly saying "That's funny" at an early stage of its development. Alas, I have no idea how to get people to like proper filmed sketches better than the half-to-zero-assed texts I toss off that do numbers.

Text: It's no longer 2006, in which filming and sharing sketches online remained a viable possibility, but it's past peak Twitter now too. In 2029, no one's going to want to read a firehose of random pithy and less-pithy sentences. Maybe vaudeville will come back. Maybe comedic novels.

Text: @Bodyisturd You may not be aware of this, and I'm not keen to have clear links between my Twitter/comedic persona and my professional persona, but I did make videos for a very popular math video channel for a time. The guy who runs that probably will get written up as a new kind of educator.
