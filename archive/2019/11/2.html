<pre>Every time I&#39;ve made a stock figure &quot;he&quot; instead of &quot;her&quot;, or said &quot;girl&quot; instead of &quot;woman&quot;, it was for character count reasons. I trust you understand similarly for the ethnic slurs and that one thread where I explored in detail my theory that the handicapped are &quot;faking it!!&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@enr0n_hubbard We&#39;re the same person. But there are worse things than being a gaping idiot void of ego and unwarranted self importance, who thus allows oneself to feel pleasant at times. I haven&#39;t internalized this lesson but I hope to. There is ego and self-importance in self-loathing as well.</pre>

<pre>@enr0n_hubbard Not that we need self-loathe further about falling prey to that narcissism, to be clear! Everything is easier said than done, but, yeah. A bit of narcissism is fine, ultimately, is my point, and one might as well then go with the happy form.</pre>
