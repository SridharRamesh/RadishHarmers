Text: The fact that emotions are physical is wild. Crying and erections and blushing and so on. It should not be possible. Descartes is physically rolling in his grave.

Text: If the bug has caused you to unfollow me or vice versa, it is fine. Do not debase yourself refollowing out of obligation. It's your timeline. If it is meant to be, we will organically re-attract each other's interest. Changing opinions are part of life, ebbs in the river.

Text: @wokeberia I made it turn up by flipping coins a lot the day RBG died. Cheating in spirit though not in law. It was unwise, though. My relationship to this site genuinely brings out many poor qualities of mine, albeit also some alright qualities.

Text: Why does Paul McCartney tell this with someone else fucking the goat? I do not understand. Would he not prefer to play the protagonist himself? Does he shy from being the center of attention?
