Text: People go all I Fucking Love Science for statistics, any statistics, just because there's numbers involved, and formulas and textbooks and whatnot. Instant credibility, regardless of whether at root the project of labelling all uncertainty with numbers makes sense.

Text: @AliceFromQueens @NateSilver538 That could've been done a lot more pithily, with less distracting nonsense, without all the voodoo numbers. Plenty of people did indeed observe "Hey, Trump might win" without all the numeric ritual.

Text: @DEEPTHROAT_ACAB @DickCountry The math of proportion and averages is interesting qua math, but the bridge principle proposing all uncertainty is to be represented and analyzed via this lens, even when any direct interpretation as such is lacking, is but searching by the streetlamp because the light is better.

Text: Apt handle for your concerns, but, the asymmetric info here appears to be that other people understand what Arrow's impossibility theorem is about, like even just the ballpark of what it's about, and you do not. https://t.co/htRQhh2TmL

Text: E.g., Arrow's Impossibility Theorem (equivalently, the non-existence of free ultrafilters) switches to possibility once the number of voters is infinite. Are we to take it, then, that staggered voting is a logistical nightmare for a finite population but easy for an infinite one?

Text: No, because AIT has nothing to do with staggered voting, nothing to do with information available or not available to voters as time passes or for any other reason, nothing to do with any of this. You might as well have said the Pythagorean theorem, it makes as much sense.

Text: @amw_stanford I think she just heard "voting impossibility theorem" at some point in the past. She runs in circles where people would mention it, I guess. She runs in circles full of people making unjustified leaps from math to something else, but this is particularly egregious even for that.

Text: This was shown impossible when this puzzle was all the craze in the late 1800s, notably by William Woolsey Johnson. In jargon, the core obstacle is the fact that permutations carry parity, of which there are two lovely distinct proofs (cycle-counting or inversion-counting).

Text: 4 by 4 grid with the Pope's image, one square left blank in the top-left. You may slide pieces around into the blank hole, thus moving the location of the blank. The image starts off scrambled with two squares swapped, and your goal is to get it back in order.

Text: Cauchy first wrote out an explicit proof of permutation parity in 1815 (by cycle-counting, the same idea noted by Johnson later), but the idea of this parity (as defined by inversion-counting) is already implicit in Cramer's writing in 1744 on his eponymous rule.
