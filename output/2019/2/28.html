Text: [In bandages, on crutches, nursing my cut-up face with a cold compress]

Text: You wouldn't know it from this website, but I'm reasonably competent and composed in real life, not constantly shouting inanely or flailing in pain. I have almost no followers in that context, though.

Text: @Hezbolsonaro @Sturgeons_Law As far as I'm concerned, it would be more impolite to NOT thank each of my followers individually for their support. Yes, it's only been women so far, but that's just the default sorting order of the spreadsheet I've been using; alphabetical on the first column, gender F or M.

Text: If you die as a kid, you're a kid in heaven. If you die when elderly, you're old in heaven. If you die with a cold, you have your cold in heaven. If you die before you retire, you have your job in heaven. If you die before you get to heaven, you have to stay on Earth in heaven.

Text: @benmschmidt "STEM" seems like an obfuscating rather than helpful way of understanding this dynamic, when Math and Statistics is on the bottom end below Political Science and Geography. Feels like all "STEM" really means here is "Computer Stuff".
