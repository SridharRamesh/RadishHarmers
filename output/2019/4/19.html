Text: I've met an absurd number of people who think The Simpsons invented the "many monkeys at typewriters, eventually producing all possible texts" trope. Borel is almost surely turning over in his carefully measured grave.

Text: @MarkMacyk Dear everyone saying this joke was stolen from Demi: This joke wasn't stolen from Demi. This is a joke a new person comes up with once a month, no doubt often independently. Demi was far from the first. Alan Wheat was the first, beating Demi by four years. https://t.co/JsZuvEDMEO

Text: @rahuldphys I appreciate the effort, but the amount of interpretation necessary to define "rational text" as meaning essentially "finite text" is such that I must decline to Like this post, for reasons of mathematical fidelity.

Text: @KRASNEROCALYPSE Just randomness (heh), a wild illustration of exuberant wealth, presumably.

Someone once said to me that The Simpsons stole this from Hitchhiker's Guide, also. Borel can't catch a break.

Text: @KRASNEROCALYPSE Honestly, I think it DOES work as a joke without being a pre-existing trope. Even a pretty good one! After all, when Borel said it, it was kind of a joke too.

Text: @rahuldphys Not sure what you mean in this appeal. It's true that the joke is often phrased with infinitely many monkeys (though neither Borel nor The Simpsons did so); however, this changes little in my pedantic qualms:

Text: @rahuldphys My objection is

A) What does it mean to consider a text rational? Shall we say a rational text is an infinitely long eventually periodic text? Fine, but then:

Text: @rahuldphys B) What do infinitely long eventually periodic texts have to do with this typewriter setup, such that we should think each of them will be produced? The odds of producing even one such text are 0%, not 100%.

Text: @rahuldphys Now, it's true that one can encode an infinitely long eventually periodic text as a finite text (using the scheme of encoding it as the finite nonperiodic part followed by some separator symbol followed by the finite text to be repeated ad infinitum, say).

Text: @rahuldphys So perhaps one might say "Each such finite encoding of an infinitely long eventually periodic text will appear with probability 100% within the infinitely long string of output of each monkey's typewriter".

Text: @rahuldphys However, this seems a very contrived interpretation of the phrase "rational text", to be used simply to mean "finite text". No one ever actually says "rational text" to mean "finite text". Hence, I'm afraid, Like denied,,,

Text: Being problematic makes you age horribly. It's science. The evidence? Old people are wrinkly and unsexy, and they all have racist mindsets, while young people with supple young skin and attitudes dominate any list of the world's hottest celebs. Meritocracy at work.

Text: @rahuldphys Is your claim that, given countably infinitely many monkeys, each typing a countably infinitely long text at independent uniform random, the probability is 100% that every eventually periodic infinite text is produced by some monkey?

Text: @rahuldphys That claim is false. In fact, with probability 100%, not a single monkey produces an eventually periodic infinite text. It's exceedingly unlikely (indeed, probability 0) to from some point on repeat some finite pattern infinitely without ever deviating.

Text: @rahuldphys With probability 100%, every mokey produces an "irrational" text. (Not all "irrational" texts get produced, but some do, while NO "rational" texts get produced)

Text: @rahuldphys That claim isn't true on this setup either... With probability 100%, not all normal texts will be produced. Every text produced will be normal, but most normal texts will not be produced. Any given normal text has probability 0% of being produced.

Text: @rahuldphys What do you mean by that? Whether an infinitely long string is normal or not is a deterministic property of the string; there's no randomness involved, just the properties of the string itself.

Text: @rahuldphys But what's the specific test? Any particular string of length N would produce the same p-value of 1/|alphabet|^N, after collecting full information (i.e., performing all possible tests, leaving nothing ignored). They'd all be equally normal or equally abnormal.
