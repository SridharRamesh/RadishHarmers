Text: @FrankieG_Baby Some people moan and complain and want everything handed to them on a platter. Others practice their Monopoly skills, night after night, knowing success is when opportunity meets preparation. As long as there are no bullshit house rules, I've got this.

Text: @ModelOfTheory Those mathematicians who do this, talking about "TRUE summation" and so on, are wrong. They have incorrectly understood the nature of mathematics, its generalizations and family resemblances and the mere historical caprice of its standardized curriculum, and they infuriate me.

Text: When I retweet somebody else's post, and then start getting notifications as my followers Like it, it is infuriating. Those retweets were for you to compare to my own content and find lacking!

Text: When Newton described the spectrum, he held a mystical fixation upon the number 7. This is why he inserted "indigo" between blue and violet, and also why he inserted blue and violet, and indeed each color besides red, the only true color; God's color, the color God physically is.

PROS
