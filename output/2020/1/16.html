Text: I gather others enjoy this sort of thing, but for me, it's real mixed emotions each time the rain is gone and I see clearly all the many obstacles in my way. Terribly disheartening.

Text: Spoofing my area code on robocalls is counterproductive. I have no increased desire to talk to some rando who attended my same high school twenty years ago or whatever. Go whole hog. Call me from my own number. That guy, I love talking to. That guy, I love the sound of his voice.

Text: I hear of far future dates (e.g., Election Day 2016 once, or Election Day 2020 now), and think "Aw, that'll take FOREVER to get here…". As finally it arrives, enough calendar ❌s later, I feel pride, like I've accomplished something, like it's to my credit.

Text: @sclv @johncarlosbaez @julianorobertrj @ProfIdini @p_m_aq @_julesh_ Group(oid) theory? Wonderful. Every mathematician is expected to learn the basics of this jewel, and to recognize its sophisticated development as a crowning achievement.

No longer presume inverses? Esoteric abstract nonsense. Wankery, not real math.

Text: Oh, really? You crow Sanders is "killing it" at the polls? Much as the Ottoman Empire was "killing it" at 1.5 million ethnic Armenians from 1914 to 1923? Perhaps some among you are merely ignorant of etymology, but I must conclude many actually welcome the invoked connotations.
