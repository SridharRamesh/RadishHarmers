Text: @FrankieG_Baby I'm unfamiliar. Show me an example of general enjoinment from using mail; even the Unabomber is allowed to write letters from prison. As for imprisonment, it comes with a trial (though many of the people around me on this site are ostensibly for both prison and police abolition).

Text: @FrankieG_Baby And sending conspiracy theory nonsense to interested subscribers seems to me not really to qualify as sending threatening harassing mail to victims; the latter harassment itself is a different criminal act.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby Leftists should examine how eagerly establishment forces would view their non-mainstream (even if correct) rants on, say, police treatment of black people or Israeli treatment of Palestinians or any such thing as similarly hateful, factually incorrect, and fomenting harassment.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby Jones is a shit (just the random spark du jour for the conversation) and giving him access to communication doesn't help the above, but broad universal regulations ensuring EVERYONE irrevocable access to communication with their interested listeners is the only robust solution.

Text: @KRASNEROCALYPSE As you say, it's not that it's a slippery slope of only further consequences to come. Already, left voices get capriciously banned or otherwise suppressed too, on similar grounds. The robust solution is to regulate universal access.
