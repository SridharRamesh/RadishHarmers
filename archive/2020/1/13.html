<pre>&quot;Highly-educated&quot;? Hardly. The very intimation is offensive. I am proud to say of myself, and every affluent Warren-supporter I know, that we are as ignorant as a bag of rocks.</pre>

<pre>My entire life, whenever I&#39;ve gotten an itch, I&#39;ve scratched it. Yet, I still to this day get itches. &quot;The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.&quot; —Albert Einstein (1879 – 1955).</pre>

<pre>&quot;I have a number of serious problems with the crime bill. But one part of it that I vigorously support is the Violence Against Women Act.&quot; —Sanders, 1994

This is the ugliness the Bernie Bros have rallied around. He wanted it enshrined into law.
