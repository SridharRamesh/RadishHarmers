Text: @marx_knopfler I looked at this diagram, then made sure to process it in a way that would result in my feeling fine instead of being upset.

Text: Granted, I could just as well have done that with regard to the quoted post itself. And I have. Everyone is saying reasonable things from different contexts, with different emphases. It's all fine. I just thought I'd make my play on the Twitter trope, as the opportunity arose.

Text: @evanewashington The type of truth values is of level 0, and the type of individuals is of level 1. A product of types has as its level the maximum of its factors' levels, and the arrow type A -&gt; B has as its level max(1 + level of A, level of B).

Text: @evanewashington In Nth order logic, you can quantify over things of level ≤ N. Also, in Nth order logic, you can normally talk about things of level ≤ N + 1, EXCEPT, in zeroth order logic, you can't talk about individuals, even though they're level 1.

Text: @evanewashington Maybe there's some slight tweak to this to make it cleaner. The "You can talk about" thing is a little fuzzy, it's not entirely clear what kinds of things people mean for you to be able to talk about even if you can't quantify over them in "Nth order logic".

Text: @evanewashington Generally, the only reason to talk about things that you can't quantify over is to apply them as predicates to the things you can quantify over. But eh. I would not have fixated on this particular ranked hierarchy thing as so important.

Text: @evanewashington Rarely do I care about Nth order logic for some finite N &gt; 1. I can see contexts where one might, but it seems rare.

Text: @evanewashington It's usually that one is interested in either propositional logic, first-order logic, or logic with the full power of function types or power types, not limited by some level scheme.

Text: @evanewashington Sorry for making this a long thread. Twitter is terrible for discussing anything that wants to be a paragraph or so instead of two sentences. And generally, when I discuss math/logic/etc, I feel paragraph-level discussion is what is called for.

Text: @evanewashington Actually, maybe I should make the type of truth values of level 1 above, and just say that calling propositional logic "zeroth order logic" is a complete exception to the otherwise rules.

Text: @evanewashington After all, one cannot quantify over functions from truth values to individuals in intuitionistic first-order logic. Function types with truth values as the domain reduce to other things classically, but are not so trivial intuitionistically.

Text: Page count isn't the relevant metric, it's far from the actual measure of completion, but it's the easiest metric to see. 

Eight pages in ten weeks. Pathetic. But eight beats eight lower numbers. If I had started doing this at the start of the pandemic, I'd be done by now. https://t.co/1iM8zT8ZZa https://t.co/KAi6yL9Ff3

Sketches are meant to be viewed rather than read, but if you are the sort of person who would enjoy reading a sketch, please tautologically enjoy. https://t.co/dT1s1V7dzG
