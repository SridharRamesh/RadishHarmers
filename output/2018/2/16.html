Text: It's fine by me that people post tritely about the horror of gun violence. It's not possible to have an original thought on the matter, but it doesn't bother me for people to keep repeating the old correct ones, as the repetitive situation keeps warranting.

Text: I had no idea Marx had written on the subject! In reading his calculus papers, it's not immediately obvious to me what the intended contributions were or the background context of the era, and thus they're neither obviously good nor bad. Will keep reading. https://t.co/wsOMPOPXm0
