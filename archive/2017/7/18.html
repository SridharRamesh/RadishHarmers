<pre>I spent my 20s pursuing a Logic PhD (co-run by Math, Philosophy) cuz Wittgenstein&#39;s &quot;Remarks(/Lectures) on Foundations of Math&quot; inspired me.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed @jhparkerb Well just usual brainfarts as happen to anyone.

Anyway, if remembering your 3-4-5 triangles counts as a &quot;geometric&quot; solution, there&#39;s that.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed @jhparkerb That is, let&#39;s first scale everything down by a factor of 3 for convenience (so A becomes a unit square).</pre>

<pre>@jcreed @jhparkerb Now we have a rectangle with diagonal 10, with side lengths b + 1and b - 1 differing by 2. Well, of course it&#39;s a 6-8-10 situation.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed @jhparkerb Maybe this counts as &quot;algebraic&quot; still; I mean, the line is blurry. Geometry is the algebra of positive def. quadratic forms, as I see it.</pre>
