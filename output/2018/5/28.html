Text: Only the person in the world who has it the very worst is entitled to complain. Anything else is an insult to their struggle. It's called "empathy"; look it up!

Text: @MarginalScribbl Honestly, I always found that clip horrifying. The guy gets beaten by the entire crew of the show at the end, right? I gather he's doing well enough for himself now, but, Jesus.

Text: Folks are always saying shit like "conservation of momentum is just logically equivalent to the invariance of physical laws under spatial translation. Surely you don't think physics is different from place to place, do you?", which irksomely overstates the matter.

Text: These Noetherean equivalences only hold under the presumption of a Lagrangian framework in the first place. Nothing logically forces physics to follow Lagrangian mechanics, except that it happens to be empirically observed to.

Text: But the people you are attempting to put in their place by baldly stating these putative equivalences aren't familiar with Lagrangian mechanics, and aren't presuming it, and would be perfectly happy to consider the possibility of physics of a different sort.

Text: Indeed, the very fact that any idiot can easily imagine spatially homogenous physics without conservation of momentum (e.g., as in various Mario games) makes your argument seem laughably fallacious to those who haven't already been trained to recognize it as merely enthymematic.

Text: Mother's Day is tricky, because of the stereotypical antipathy between mothers and their own mother-in-laws. It is impossible to make every mother happy; their interests are opposed, there is not solidarity.

Text: Libertarians have this weird idea that corporations are better (less controlling, freedom-infringing, etc.) than governments, like every startup doesn't long to be the British East India Company if it could get a chance.
