<pre>Ah, the Riddle of the Sphinx: What has four legs at dawn, one nose at noon, and no nose by dusk? Follow-up, how does it smell? Many answer cheekily, only to lose limbs to the enraged creature, who hates both insult and clever reinterpretation of its plain and plaintive queries.</pre>

<pre>Baby Spice was born after Eminem (Em in the place who likes it in your face) figured out which Spice Girl to impregnate and then got with said Spice Girl&#39;s friends. Her sugar comes from Eminem, and her spice of course from her mom; the everything nice traces to Mitochondrial Eve.</pre>
