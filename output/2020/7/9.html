Text: @yarbsalocin @HerRoyalKahnum @alicekeeler There is actually an interesting question with an answer of great importance and wide-ranging usefulness in math, as to why we can have an equation like this, where different factors multiply to the same result, but can't do the same thing if all the factors are prime.
