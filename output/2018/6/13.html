Text: rational, etc, etc, (all of which is true), therefore the DPRK is actually a good and cool place. This last inference, eh...

And similarly for some other places in the world or history to which this logic seems to get applied.)

Text: I feel like some strains of socialist commentary I've surrounded myself with have convinced themselves that just because the US is an aggressive, imperialist, hypocritical country still immersed in propaganda and tall-tales about the DPRK, and whose actions make certain responses

Text: @tradeunionist_ @rogerbellin Here you go. For one night only, I'm public. (If any potential employer is not only scouring social media for reasons not to hire me, but furthermore staying up into the late hours of the night to do so, well, fuck, that's probably not a place for me...)

Text: (Of course there are complicated ways to show this; a known fact is a known fact. But I'm trying to find the Way From The Book, as it were, for this particular one.)

Text: Taking x! to be the integral of t^x/e^t dt over all positive t, as is often done, is there any simple/easy way to establish the asymptotic that (n + x)! ~ n! n^x for fixed x and large n (thus equating the integral and infinite product definitions of the generalized factorial)?

Text: @loundcushblount At the moment, the best I've got is the observation that the integral of t^x (1 - t/n)^n dt over t in [0, n] is n^(x + 1) * n!/((x + 1) * (x + 2) * ... (x + n + 1)). Taking the limit as n → ∞, the LHS becomes the integral def and the RHS the infinite product def of x!.

Text: @loundcushblount That's pretty good, but it feels a little out of the blue, compared to starting from the integral definition and watching the asymptotics naturally fall out of it. I'm hoping to discover something more straightforward along those lines, in some vague ineffable sense.

Text: @loundcushblount But over time, I may just acclimate to liking this approach anyway.

Text: @loundcushblount Anyway, I retain the position that the infinite product def is usually far better as starting point, but sometimes the integral does come up (x^n/n! as the n-th integral of 1, w/fractional integration taken via Laplace transform), and one then wants to see the equivalence easily.

Text: @loundcushblount I'm an abstraction guy through and through (I'm a category-theoretic logician by specialty), but I like this classical stuff too. I like everything. Except shitting on students.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law And which immediately attracted the same "Are you fucking kidding me?" reaction it's getting now. This kind of thinking is foolish, but put so explicitly, everyone recognized it as such, even those who might submit to such thinking in other, subtler ways.  https://t.co/T1fSHXieDI
