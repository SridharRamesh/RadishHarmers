While I do so, slowly, my plane re-enters view at the bottom of frame, directly below, matching my horizontal [4/5]</pre>

I try the lever again. At first, this is to no avail; then, with both hands, I make one strong jerk, and suddenly, the canopy shatters away, [2/5]

<pre>I&#39;m honestly, in my comedic sensibilities, rather a bit of a prude; just along different axes than certain ones oft-invoked for superficial evaluation and scolding. Such mechanical rubrics seem to me completely broken, but I have my own standards I don&#39;t always hit.</pre>

<pre>@mtracey @Tankie_Viciedo Michael, I honestly think you get a lot of unfair shit you don&#39;t deserve, I think people read you in perverse bad faith all the time, but c&#39;mon, this is an easy one. 3 words and it&#39;s done. It&#39;s not even a big claim. All presidents are bad, all billionaires are bad, it&#39;s so easy.</pre>

<pre>@Tankie_Viciedo @mtracey Oh, I don&#39;t know about that last part. I&#39;ve heard rumblings of various separate campaigns, supported by high-level figures in the U.S. government, seeking over the next couple years to remove and replace the President. Not sure how realistic such meddling ambitions are, though.</pre>
