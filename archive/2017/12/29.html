<pre>@FrankieG_Baby https://t.co/xcPHCTkQbo. You can search Twitter to see the deranged things people are saying should happen to the people responsible for such a mild jibe. Luckily, none of it WILL happen, but as a pro-joke person, the attitude irks me.</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby You can watch the video itself here: https://t.co/3BuehWIbOK. Keep in mind, they made a number of these videos for a number of politicians (also Donald Trump, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and Gary Cohn).</pre>

<pre>@investmntwanker @wcthunderesq FWIW, I&#39;ve found GCM rather ridiculous in general (e.g., unlike everyone else in these parts, I thought Fang trounced him in their debate); he&#39;s not my cup of tea. BUT, I am very pro- academics (and everyone) being able to freely voice their politics and still have job security.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@investmntwanker @wcthunderesq So this was the focus of my question; job security for academics. Even &quot;dweeby edgelord&quot; professors, or whatever offense one may take him to have committed, oughtn&#39;t be drummed out of the academy over this sort of thing, and so that is what I was curious about.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@investmntwanker @wcthunderesq Sure. To be clear, I have no knowledge of his academic work, and no judgement of it (and my main point here is he shouldn&#39;t have been made to leave his job). The things I found ridiculous (perhaps a better word is &quot;silly&quot;) were just things like his Twitter, but that&#39;s irrelevant.</pre>

<pre>Killed a tweet that would&#39;ve def done numbers, because, on reflection, eh. The Daou poll is actually fine by me; let him ask and get some answers. He&#39;s a lunk in so many ways, and he def &quot;presents white&quot;, but it&#39;s all made-up and his case is thorny and I&#39;m not bothered he asked.</pre>

<pre>At times, I can feel consciously my own opinions pulled in the direction that would do best numbers, and it is terrifying, for god knows how often, how near-constantly, this is happening in my mind sans warning. An inevitability, a fact of life, but I hate seeing my sausage made.</pre>

<pre>And I say &quot;do numbers&quot;, but this is as much of a phenomenon offline as it is online; it was present in academia, it is present in friendship, it is everywhere where it matters what other people think, which I have yet to find lacking in any interaction involving multiple people.</pre>
