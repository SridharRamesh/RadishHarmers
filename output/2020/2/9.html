Text: Iowa Caucus Demographics (NYT)

Nonwhite women
45% - Bernie
55% - Not Bernie

All Nonwhite
39% - Bernie
61% - Not Bernie

Women 18-44
43% - Bernie
57% - Not Bernie

Bernie Sanders continues to struggle with women and with people of color, who for the most part do not support him. https://t.co/Su4pgCdlhI

Text: Everyone calm down. This quote is correct. The erroneous rounding process was necessary to yield integer results, which fully correct division would not do. https://t.co/XmPS7hn0FB

Text: I'm completely against a mandatory "national service" program for youth even if it isn't only via military service. I don't care. Elders make kids do enough bullshit for "character" and "In my day…" already. People shouldn't be forced to do anything.  Let them live their lives.
