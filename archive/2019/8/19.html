Not that interesting. But wow, some people have been trained to give such weirdly dumb criticism instead.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I may give it a rewatch just to see if it grows on me. Knowing ahead of time not to expect much plot often helps me enjoy this sort of movie more. I expect I still won&#39;t get much interesting out of the ending; it was fresh in Inglourious Basterds, now it&#39;s too rote.</p></blockquote>
