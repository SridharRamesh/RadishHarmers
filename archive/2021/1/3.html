<pre>@noahdmancino @tequehead This makes up a definition of &quot;strongly coherent doxastic states&quot;, with which I would quibble (Why assign scores as an affine function of the mere cardinalities of right and of wrong beliefs? It&#39;s just made up. One could assign scores in other ways), but even putting that aside,</pre>

<pre>@noahdmancino @tequehead the only conclusion it draws about probability is that using a probability distribution and a probability threshold is one sufficient condition for arriving at a strongly coherent doxastic state. But there are plenty of strongly coherent doxastic states that are not of this form.</pre>
