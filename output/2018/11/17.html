Text: Ah, the Riddle of the Sphinx: What has four legs at dawn, one nose at noon, and no nose by dusk? Follow-up, how does it smell? Many answer cheekily, only to lose limbs to the enraged creature, who hates both insult and clever reinterpretation of its plain and plaintive queries.

Text: Baby Spice was born after Eminem (Em in the place who likes it in your face) figured out which Spice Girl to impregnate and then got with said Spice Girl's friends. Her sugar comes from Eminem, and her spice of course from her mom; the everything nice traces to Mitochondrial Eve.

Text: At times, it becomes so clear to me that with just a few small changes, just a modicum of discipline, my life could be 100x better.

But then I recall only ordinal utility is sensible, cardinal utility is meaningless, and thus so is this "insight", and thus I continue status quo.
