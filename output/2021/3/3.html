Text: @SkeleCap @Bonecondor @quantian1 In this particular heartbreaking case, Yglesias is the one more on the right side of things, vs his horrible repliers. Yglesias churns out a couple of these every now and then, to keep us on our toes.

Text: @SkeleCap @quantian1 @Bonecondor There's more to fairness than just paying the author. There's also consideration of when all the other people in the world get to do things they wish to do which copyright prevents them from doing. Many of us feel it absurdly unfair to prohibit them from doing so for so long.

Text: @SkeleCap @quantian1 @Bonecondor It's a trade-off of competing interests. Authors will of course prefer the maximum control and payment to them possible, as concerns their own works. But there are other people in the world too. Even authors benefit from public domain, for all the works they did not author.
