<pre>They say you shouldn&#39;t pursue a career as an academic unless you realize you absolutely couldn&#39;t bear to do anything else. Well, I hate everything else so much. The trouble is, I also hate academia.</pre>

<pre>I should never have learnt to code. (Or, rather, I should never have publicly noted I had). My life would&#39;ve proceeded more interestingly.</pre>

<pre>Measure my life out in lines of code. Tally up my contributions to employers and to GitHub, and when, at St. Peter&#39;s gate, my repo is found lacking, well... I won&#39;t put up a fight. I&#39;ll accept my fate with dignity; rules are rules.</pre>

<pre>I&#39;d have an easier time getting a job if they didn&#39;t make you perform convincing passion for it. I&#39;m supposed to train to be an actor now, too? If I could do that, I&#39;d just apply directly to acting jobs.</pre>

Just let me grit my teeth and we can both still gain the same gains from the transaction.</pre>

<pre>I mean, there are things I AM passionate about, and unusually good at, and which society claims to value, but it won&#39;t give me space to make the greater contributions to the world I could make in that way. The economy doesn&#39;t actually care about squandering comparative advantage.</pre>
