Text: @frankieg_baby @mattcasey Arms can be in a fair number of different positions with hands in the same place, which it would be disorienting to see misrepresented, I'm guessing is the reasoning.

Text: @frankieg_baby @mattcasey You don't need math (although there are such things, sure). Just hold your hands in one position and bend your arm in various ways. It's hardly so rigid.

If you do want to see some math in this area, look up the Dirac plate trick.

Text: @frankieg_baby @mattcasey The location of your arm is rigidly determined by your hands when your arm is fully extended (ignoring the fact that you can roll your hand 360 degrees around, from palm up to down and back again), but that's not usually where your hands are.

Text: @frankieg_baby @mattcasey Lay your hand flat on the edge of the table comfortably, arm not fully extended. Bend your elbow so your arm is above your hand. Bend so your arm is below your hand. Bend so your arm is to the side of your hand.

Text: @frankieg_baby @mattcasey Yes. But that's still two different arm configurations that result in the same glove position. That's minor, though, that parenthetical isn't my main point, it's just me covering myself pedantically.
