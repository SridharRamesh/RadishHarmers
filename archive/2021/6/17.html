<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fritz Lang&#39;s masterpiece Metropolis came in for criticism for its extensive running time. It was cut substantially after its German premiere, with a large portion of Lang&#39;s original footage removed and indeed long feared lost. The resulting heavily truncated edit is known as M.</p></blockquote>

Why was it shot down? It was shot down because it was thought this name would be too confusingly similar to the nation&#39;s capital city, the District of Columbia.</p></blockquote>
