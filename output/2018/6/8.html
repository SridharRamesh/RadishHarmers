Text: Hm, on re-read, I'm not sure I effectively and understandably said what I wanted to say here after the needed surgery to cut it down to 280, but maybe some of the gist got through anyway.

(Bump us up to 560. And then beyond. I will never be happy with any character constraints.)

Text: @RuckCohlchez @haircut_hippie @k_shivers @Snowden Your memory needs some revising... Wikileaks didn't exist in 2004. It posted its first leak in December 2006, but it barely did anything of note during its two pre-Obama years.

Text: @RuckCohlchez @haircut_hippie @k_shivers @Snowden Oh, fuck, I'm locked, so you won't see this.

Anyway, nobody really cared about or talked about Julian Assange prior to 2010, when he published the Chelsea Manning leaks. Indeed, there wasn't even a Wikipedia page about him until 2010; see https://t.co/FqhXBT8QwY.

Text: @RuckCohlchez @haircut_hippie @k_shivers @Snowden I know Twitter search isn't necessarily the most reliable thing, but, look: there's only one tweet on all of Twitter about Assange prior to the year 2009: https://t.co/AYJIvb7lN2

Text: I don't think anyone really knows how to help anyone who is "struggling", because people struggle for reasons, non-generic factors in the external world impacting them that they don't have means to fix. (Were it but a matter of words, they'd do it themselves and be done with it.)

Text: ✳️ I don't want anyone to tell me what to do, ever. Some boss in charge of my life? Fuck off.

✳️ I don't know WTF I'm doing; what job to get, how to get it, where to live, who to date, which hobby to have, the right life choices! Please, someone, anyone, tell me what to do!!

Text: I mean, double clicking on the Twitter website seems to amount, sometimes, to clicking the Back button (even going back to non-Twitter sites). I just don't understand why, or under what conditions, or how to stop this behavior I do not want.

Text: @hatfinisher FWIW, this all rings true with my own feelings and worries (though I didn't even finish writing up my thesis/get my PhD), so, at least this kind of fretting is not an uncommon experience. Best of luck with finding a way to make things work, whatever that ends up meaning for you.

Text: @hatfinisher (I didn't have your extra worries about navigating the classroom as trans either, but I mean to express sympathy for the "ex-academic mathematician, maybe I should've stayed, maybe I should re-enter, is that possible?, is that reasonable?, I dunno" aspect)

Text: This sort of thing has always been bizarre to me about our setup with everyone working the same hours every day, largely without discretion for rearrangement. How do basic needs like this get fulfilled? (I know; they don't)

Text: I mean, I happen to have picked this therapy example since it's currently what people are talking about, but even more ordinary doctor's appointments, or a million other tasks one ought see to, are all subject to the same phenomenon.

Text: Perhaps the main reason "mathematics… is a young man's game" is because most people, as they age, are no longer given support to think about it. Other concerns are forced to take over.

Text: No, don't do it! Take heart: see how upset folks would be if you died, if you've become well-accomplished? Your life is far from meaningless and without impact, given your success and acclaim.
