Text: They say Gros Michels taste way better than Cavendishes. I'll never get to tell, myself, but I'll bet they do. I'll bet they goddamn do. And yet… And yet… Even Cavendishes already taste amazing! (They topped that?) What a wonderful world! Ah, I'm smiling just thinking about it.

Text: That fable on the absurdly long spoons in Hell, everyone starving unable to eat, while in Heaven they get the same spoons but just feed each other. It's like that with everyone in the world being so harshly down on themselves, but (thankfully) boosting up their friends' esteem.

Text: Whenever I meet someone new, they can't shut up about C. V. Sridhar (22 July 1933 – 20 October 2008), giggling childishly. Like, I get it already! He was an Indian screenwriter and film director. He has directed nearly 60 films in Tamil, Hindi and Telugu.

Text: @jcreed @sclv "Anna's story is about my officemate in grad school… He was flying from London to the US right after the waterbombing incident." by David Zureick-Brown is reasonably specific, but I still doubt it. The incentives to embellish are too high, and the joke pre-exists too much.
