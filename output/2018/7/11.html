Text: Movies have trained me to be scared of opening my bathroom mirror cabinet (or rather, of closing it afterward). I avoid the room entirely.

Text: It was actually a great relief to me as a child when I realized I did not want to be a rock star. One less ambition to worry about; one less eventual source of midlife crisis frustration.

Text: @AllenVentano @errorwrong Though now preserved in original form primarily in Canada, it was originally an American military term, which Tom Wolfe bowdlerized and popularized in The Right Stuff as "screw the pooch". This is not a joke.

Text: It naively seems to me Nixon likely genuinely is inspired by democratic socialism now, and so to me it is a clearly good thing for her to newly seek to ally herself with it. It is to me good for a movement I want to see be successful and influence policy to grow more popular.

Text: Kids love anti-humor, because our society has advanced to the bizarre point where the first discrete joke each child is taught is the chicken crossing the road one. It takes them a while to understand, but once they crack that code, they run wild with it.

I hope you croak: You really are a piece of shit, you know that?
Bespoke: You, when I have your skin sewn into a fine jacket to wear to your funeral. (You are also a joke, for what it's worth.)

Text: In faux friendliness, everything my ex-health insurance website does addresses me by first name (and DOB) only. I bet this'll screw me when I use these as documents proving loss of coverage for special enrollment for new insurance. I trust nothing to run smoothly in this machine.
