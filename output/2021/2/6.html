Text: @da_last_boss In case this isn't clear, this is a logician's intentional parody of Objectivist logic. See its description as a "send-up of Objectivist theory" at https://t.co/oeg9bLu48J, its description as "A parody of Objectivist thought" at https://t.co/qkhCz50IXN, and so on.

Text: @fivefactormodel @PlateauUkok @AliceFromQueens If the UBI is paid on a regular enough schedule, it'll be pretty difficult for anyone to end up losing the ability to cover their primal needs. Regardless, how does one want to help such people? Fine, then do that and also give everyone a UBI.

Text: @fivefactormodel @PlateauUkok @AliceFromQueens The UBI isn't to replace treatment for drug addiction or mental illness or whatever, any more than it's meant to replace the existence of doctors and firefighters and so on. Have all that too.
