<pre>Columbus, you dolt! We were to go to India, for its wonderful spices (Black pepper! The mouth waters!). Instead, you&#39;ve steered us way off, you dummy, you goddamn moron, you colossal historical blunderer. Nothing here, save these &quot;chili&quot;s. What&#39;re we gonna say when we get back?</pre>
