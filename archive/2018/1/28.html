<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Final Sketchfest show went great; very warm crowd. Also, got to have extremely minor green room interactions with comedy celebs. But I decided to skip the afterparty, for some dumb reason that I already regret. Well, I&#39;ll make it up next year.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@FrankieG_Baby Everyone says the Speakeasy place the party&#39;s at tonight is amazing, so I should&#39;ve just gone to that one, but, yeah, I somehow talked myself into not going (after everyone else from Naptime bailed on me for, uh, naptime). I should go to the one tomorrow, as you say.</p></blockquote>
