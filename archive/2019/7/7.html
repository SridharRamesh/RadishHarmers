<pre>@needzmoarumlaut @TediousturtleZ @biIIosopher I wasn&#39;t accusing anyone of stealing anything. This is clearly a thought many, many people have come up with independently over the years (see https://t.co/nCTG6qcL78). I just like the idea of the first one to post it finally getting some recognition, once it randomly goes viral.</pre>

<pre>(This is the sort of ephemeral insular extremely online shit I&#39;d like to get away from doing, though I guess it&#39;s fine, as long as it doesn&#39;t distract from also doing better stuff that lasts. I think maybe it does distract, though.)</pre>

<pre>Scrolling the TL is fine, just like scrolling Slashdot, but a fine ladder to nowhere. I&#39;m going to make myself spend more time on more productive pursuits for a bit. I&#39;ll return in August, unless I think of something really good. I have no willpower. I&#39;ll probably post tomorrow.</pre>
