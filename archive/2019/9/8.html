<pre>I&#39;m supposed to trust a face-rater that can&#39;t even tell on its own where my eyes, chin, hair, and mouth are? Nonsense. I will go on believing myself to be alternately a 95% or a 12%, depending on my most recent human interaction, as always.</pre>

<pre>To do anything worthwhile in art, you must force yourself to be original, to push against the tide and shed copycat imitation of all others. This is why Beethoven deliberately deafened himself, the source of his musical talent. This is why Tolstoy never learnt to read or write.</pre>

<pre>@PRDGM1 I irk a bit when people present &quot;almost all&quot; this way, though. &quot;almost all&quot; is only relative to some measure. For other measures, this is not true. And clearly, the translation-invariant measure for which this is true does not track with how humans &quot;draw&quot; numbers as noteworthy.</pre>

<pre>@birdshit_420 @PRDGM1 The fact may not be directly related, but the phenomenon is similar, in that it&#39;s also true in the same translation-invariant measure sense that &quot;almost all&quot; numbers are normal, yet no one&#39;s proven any number of arithmetic note as such to be normal.</pre>

<pre>@birdshit_420 @PRDGM1 In a former life, as people say, I was a mathematician/logician, specializing in category theory. Perhaps I still am, but I left my PhD mid-dissertation-writing. I oft fantasize about finishing it still, but there&#39;s so many things one wants to do and so little free time.</pre>

<pre>@birdshit_420 @PRDGM1 Thanks for the comedy compliment. Also, as an algebraic topologist, you may appreciate this video I once made, showing some key such ideas to a wide audience. There was to be a sequel on Brouwer&#39;s fixed point theorem and Borsuk-Ulam, but, best laid plans… https://t.co/xSJxGIuExI</pre>

<pre>@sclv @jamestanton It would be if the circles were allowed to intersect. Since they&#39;ve been barred from this, it seems, we are dealing only with those finite posets which amount to rooted forests; adding one meta-circle/-root encompassing everything, these amount to rooted trees, as you discovered.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@shachaf @CreeepyJoe These circles have been barred from intersection, so it&#39;s a classification of preorders in which the values above any given value are linearly ordered; i.e., a classification of rooted forests. Adding a meta-circle/-root encompassing everything, these amount to rooted trees.</pre>

By the time I&#39;m a proper adult, the ship will&#39;ve sailed so far one could measure Earth&#39;s curve from its dip into the horizon.</pre>

<pre>All my anxiety posts appeared to me in a creative dream, after hours of tranquil meditation in lotus pose. I sip hot cocoa in my smoking jacket, then stroll leisurely to the laptop to type &quot;There&#39;s something wrong with me, but no one will tell me what it is, so I can&#39;t fix it…&quot;.</pre>
