Text: In the mid-nineties, when not many people had used the Internet, there was a popular joke, "What's O.J. Simpson's e-mail address? Slash, backslash, escape". You couldn't tell that joke anymore; it wouldn't work. The moment you hit Esc, it would close the tweet composition window.

Text: The first ancient human to near staying awake for 24 hours straight thought it an incredible accomplishment, a Magellan-type feat, till they too were punished for their hubris and murdered by natives. I've said it before and I'll say it again, folks: you can't trust natives.

Text: I bet Terrence Howard would say it should be between Hom(xG, y) and ùêªùëúùëö(ùê∫, ùë•), am I right, folks? What is that nut even thinking? "Uhh 1 x 1 = 2 uhh I re-inflict on women the very physical abuse I suffered as a child uhh Hom(G, x)‚Ä¶"? Fucking roasted. https://t.co/31Qd3HHHpP

Text: @cbarrett In my original post, part of the explanation is that x and y are to be functors, so "xG" and "yF" are just ordinary composition. But don't expect that dummy Terry to get it! He still thinks composition with the identity functor is the same as coproduct with the identity functor!

JAMOKE: You, again. Haha!
I HOPE YOU CROAK: You really are a piece of shit, you know that?
BESPOKE: You, when I have your skin sewn into a fine jacket to wear to your funeral. (You are also a joke, for what it's worth.)

Text: Till then, I've got to hide my intentions subtly, but I'm still wearing my baseball cap backwards; a little shibboleth for those "in the know". Playing it cool while playing it cool. Haha, look, I'm wearing the hat in plain sight, yet this insurance rep doesn't suspect a thing.

Text: For God's sake, everyone, please stick to dating within your league. There are clear, physically defined leagues. If you have to ask which league you're in‚Ä¶ Buddy, it's bad.

Now go out there, you ambitious stunning millennials, newly super confident like the superstars you are! https://t.co/b0jHdB7hem

Text: @georgiamarxist Er, what? This seems trivially different from having d/dx x^(-n) = -nx^(-n-1) at one's fingertips, which is presumably what you are contrasting this with. Are there really people who have the one but not the other in their easy-to-access mathematical toolbox?

Text: Still excited by cookies? You child. You philistine. Me, I'm beyond that cookie-cutter shit. I eat only bespoke foods. I eat only grains of rice with my name handwritten on them, and to avoid any possibility of mass manufacture, I legally change my name unpredictably each day.

Text: Anytime I tweet a joke that only makes sense to the extremely online, I am disgusted. What a waste of mental energy. I could've been bonding with family, cooking meals for the indigent, learning to play piano. This very post is in similar territory. I'm shaking, covered in sweat.
