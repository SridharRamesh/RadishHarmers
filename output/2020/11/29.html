Text: Actually, I should say, the Fast Fourier Transform approach needn't be seen as using on the order of N log(N) many primitive multiplications. It's natural to construe it as using N many primitive multiplications, but what jumps up to the order N log(N) is the number of additions.

Text: @asmeurer Applications of category theory to logic. My PhD research (though I left without finishing writing my dissertation) was on a category-theoretic framing and generalization of Gödel's incompleteness theorems/Löb's theorem, and the associated Gödel-Löb modal logic of provability.

Text: "on the order of N many primitive multiplications", I mean. It's Twitter, there will be little typos or omissions of this sort, no edit button, I won't correct the rest.

Text: @quantian1 I only did Karatsuba multiplication in detail. I was considering writing out the order-4 DFT approach as you did, though I would've just worked abstractly in Z[x] mod x^2 + 1, and the whole thing would've alas been less efficient than Karatsuba, at this low N.

Text: @quantian1 Or I could write out an order-3 DFT approach, but I felt using order-4 would make it easier to show dynamics specific to the Fast Fourier Transform. Not that anyone would really pick up much any of this from my writing out a single low N example, of course. But that was my plan.

Text: @GutStrings The first post is a joke and the rest are real. But to be clear, "Vedic math" is a bunch of pointless trivialities, it's nothing (and has nothing to do with the Vedas or Vedic era), while the posts in this thread after the first one are on genuine valuable math.

Text: @dannyburt33 Perhaps it's better because everyone can keep their masks on. Not that I know how bad or innocuous it is, but that does seem like a potential difference.
