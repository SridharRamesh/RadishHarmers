<pre>I actually think the post everyone including me is quote-tweeting and making fun of is fine. It&#39;s fine to say something dumb, idle chatter, most posts are fine. They&#39;re just springboards for me to make my own jokes. When those are dumb, it&#39;s fine too.</pre>

<pre>@feraljokes This is correct, it&#39;s dumb to main character someone over this, it&#39;s dumb to take it as worth such attention at all, that someone in a world of 7 billion people maybe said something foolish. But also, I think a post with 25K Likes can take some ribbing as well. She&#39;ll be fine.</pre>
