<pre>I&#39;m not too old to have kids, but I near too old to meet someone, fall in love, build a life together, and THEN have kids. Plus fixing up all my other problems. By the time I become a proper adult, the ship will&#39;ve sailed so far, one could measure Earth&#39;s curvature from its dip.</pre>

<pre>The entire origin sequence from The Tree of Life plays. Minimal dialogue, no handholding. 17 minute montage: Big Bang through Earth&#39;s creation, emergence of microbial life, and evolution of dinosaurs. Finally, an office chair in garish color, as the Better Call Saul theme starts.</pre>

<pre>I have more talent in my little finger than I have in my entire body, the rest of which is filled with sizable quantities of negative talent. I am 60% water by weight, and 70% negative talent, with a remaining 55% each of vital organs and of baking soda.</pre>
