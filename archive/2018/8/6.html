<pre>@DrNO_NC @bridgietherease Because they&#39;re where all modern distribution takes place. If they don&#39;t host it, it essentially doesn&#39;t exist. If the argument is that they get to do what they want because they&#39;re private, well, they are de facto monopolies and, in my opinion, ought as well be nationalized.</pre>

Hardly a monopoly, with so many alternatives.&quot;.</pre>
