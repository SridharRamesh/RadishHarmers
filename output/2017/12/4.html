Text: Friends of mine, please, please, let's just watch a movie or something instead. Watch a movie or pig out on food or do a bunch of trust falls or stop being friends or plan a bank heist; something, anything.

Text: I have this weird idiosyncratic thing called ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response). Hard to explain, but to me and a few freaks like me, there's just something about videos of attractive women whispering that's bizarrely pleasurable. Perhaps someday science will explain it.

Text: I should say, it's not just whispering. ASMR covers a variety of sounds. It could be attractive women cooing, attractive women yelling, attractive women speaking at a normal conversational level, or even attractive women completely silent. Many different triggers have been noted.
