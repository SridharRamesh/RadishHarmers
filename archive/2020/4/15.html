<pre>Italian chef, &quot;Straight-a from Napoli!&quot;, with extravagantly gesturing hands and Mario-style accent and so on, hand-tossing pizza dough, meticulously, lovingly, just so, and then, with similar care, proudly topping it with strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate.</pre>

<pre>This is no time to quibble about the aesthetics. We&#39;ve seen significantly lower transmission in Asian countries where face mask usage is more normalized. https://t.co/h6I64vN4QO</pre>

<pre>Of course Trump is putting his name on the checks. You younger folks may not remember, but a check isn&#39;t valid unless it&#39;s signed.</pre>

<pre>I wrote one of mine about a toilet and included a photo. I sent it to my top six desired schools, all of which rejected me. They would&#39;ve done so anyway. I refuse to budge from my theory an inch.</pre>

<pre>@bridgietherease I did do this, but I also did want to go to those schools. I was 17 at the time, so, a mixed bag. Later on, I went to one of them for grad school. There&#39;s no grand point to this epilogue, I&#39;m just recounting memories.</pre>

<pre>@allahliker Having looked up the photo (https://t.co/9tmvN0DVMI), I guess I&#39;m just some undecorated man as well, but I feel like, you have enough art and photos on your mantel that it infuriates me to consider you still being reflexively taken to task for not having art all over the walls.</pre>
