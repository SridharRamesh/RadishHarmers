Text: @HuxleyDick @ankyloren Yes, I don't assert mathematical claims I can't prove. The proof is very simple: solve for base in terms of D, and observe that this gives base as a sum of whole numbers plus a 5/D term. So D must be a factor of 5; thus, 1 or 5. And plugging those back in makes base ten.

Text: @mirrorsaw_ @papa_rosh @shreyabasu003 Being Indian-American is fine. You're all fine in my book. It's the process that selects which Indian-Americans to grant fame and acclaim which is horribly broken.

Text: Judging from the conversations I've been part of, people shit constantly on anyone and everyone behind their back, no one is safe, except for me. I don't know why everyone likes me so much, but thank you.

Text: On entry to Hell, it is announced that you will be tortured by hearing everything ever said about you behind your back. But then it turns out it's not much, barely anything, you're not that big a deal.

Text: You are dating someone two years younger? That's disgusting. When they were a toddler, you were twice their age. You're old enough to be their parent at the time.
