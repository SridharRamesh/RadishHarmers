Text: @dog_envier Good question. Well, he lucked into FB after that (such luck, but in a planet of 7 billion that happens), and then I guess Tesla and SpaceX hit a sweet spot of nerd sci-fi fantasies (whether or not they deliver so much in reality), so nerds defend him to death and hype his stock.

Text: @chiweethedog I wouldn't mind if it paid off, but as you said, the movie thinks it's smarter than it is. It's just a dumb action flick. The idea of a dream within a dream is straightforward, children get it, it's no big deal, but everyone talks about the movie like it's college math.

Text: @rhesustome Well, I specialized in logic, and within that, in connections between category theory and logic, but I'm not sure that is the right thing to say for "favorite kind". I'm not sure that's the most relevant kind of kind. But it's the easy thing to say for now, so I'll say that.
