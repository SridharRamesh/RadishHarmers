Text: My phone's display is really badly fucked up, almost completely unusable. Bizarre colors and patterns of lines, shifting every few days. I'd take a photo to show you, but it's the one thing it's rather difficult to photograph.

Text: @liftrss I found out today that my boss is 25. I'm firmly into my 30s. I'm fretting to get my health insurance set up through the company, and my boss is still on his parents'.

Text: @liftrss Ever since the boating accident, I've had no arms, chest, or lower body. It has been my smirking secret until today.

Text: @liftrss Yeah; apart from the above, for me, this news is extremely neutral. It is about what I expected. (I just wanted to join in on the bad news fun…)

Text: Boys DM: Ah, that @radishharmers is such a clever and impressive fellow. I look forward each day to his tweets.

Girls DM: A worthy choice for all to follow. This site would be immeasurably poorer without ol' Sridhar.

Text: @Styl_oh Seriously, though I hate trying to convey pronunciations through "phonetic spelling" (the most ambiguity-laden thing) instead of IPA, /ʃrɪdar/ would be like "Shrid-are", and /ʃrid̪ʰɚ/ would be like (though not exactly) "Shree-ther" (with a "th" like in "the", not like in "thin").
