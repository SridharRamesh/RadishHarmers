<pre>But I do have a soft spot for this song, trite as its repeated use is, empty as it is for rich people to be the ones singing it. Maybe I&#39;m just still 16, but I find it impressive that it opens with &quot;Imagine there&#39;s no heaven&quot; and yet this being a statement of idealistic optimism.</pre>
