Text: Ah, @AOC, this offer is open to you as well. Any game of your choosing; I'll even do Brawl, even though Melee was way better.

Text: Are Twitch and Tick Tock the same thing? What happened to Vine? Which channel should I tune my receiver to (finally got a UHF antenna this Christmas), and at what time do these air?

Text: @bridgietherease @clementix The other one is way less famous, and not one of the two actually well-known works by its author. It's honestly not fair or realistic to expect anyone to recognize it. But it's the only one of his publications (nearly all posthumous) that was given a visually notable cover.

Text: FORMAT CHANGE: I shall from hereon be following the counsel of my mountaintop guru, who has instructed me to alternate posts and real-world accomplishments, in strict 1:1 balance. I'll start off the alternation with a post, to ensure I get to make at least one last one.

Text: @bridgietherease @clementix For what it's worth, the cover is a reference to G.E. Moore's declaration "Here is one hand. And here is another.".

Text: I want to set something up where I can make blogposts and then people can reply with comments that thread nicely, with good support for searching, linking between posts, LaTeXed math, and editing posts after publication while also keeping backups just in case. What should I use?

Text: I suppose this is basically like a Wiki, except with good LaTeX support and maybe better threaded comments for discussion, and easier ability to keep track of what's new. Like nLab + nForum. The goal is to use this to discuss math with a few friends; nothing large-scale.

Text: Such an early reader. I was reading in diapers at 2! One of many ways I, an adult, am smarter than you. Spent so much time with my head in a book, I never got around to learning how to walk. That, I've had to fake this whole time. My one regret. Now fetch me my reading diapers.

Text: @marketingCJR I was going to say "Give it time...", but I'm also surprised to see that, yet, you yourself didn't Like it? No wonder the ratings are skewed.
