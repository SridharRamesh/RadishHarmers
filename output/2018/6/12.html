Text: One dumb trope invoked in Boomer vs. Millennial conversation is some idea that Boomers got pensions and Millennials didn't. Nah, that's not how it works. The Boomers are the ones just retiring now, in the current era, when pensions do not exist. They fucked over the Boomers, too.

Text: Though Boomers grew up in many conditions now missed, that change involved a small slice of the Boomers fucking over, albeit later in life, the mass of Boomers too. And a small slice of Millennials stand in line to just as eagerly exploit future generations as well, and so on.

Text: @faceplant10 Everyone's too hung up on their various conflated frustrations with their parents, a tangled mass building up since adolescence, to analyze the matter clearly.

Text: @spindlypete Oh, you have no idea... Check out what every South Indian on this site has been up to.

Text: Fetch me the Mendelssohn to my Bach, the Boswell to my Johnson. Even if not Ramanujan, I could still use a Hardy. Fuck, this has become more innuendish than intended.

Text: Ever since the bus accident, I've panicked in flashback for a moment every time I hear a loud gunshot nearby. It's terribly embarrassing.

Text: I never hear back from The New Yorker on any of my submissions. Am I sending them to the right place? What's that mnemonic again? I believe it was something like "Write to me, Eustace Tilley, P.O. Box 963; New York City, New York State, 10108!".

Text: Vertigo IS terribly boring, a bunch of tremendously overrated nothing. All the critics who panned it upon original release were correct. If he'd just left it at that, he would've nailed it. https://t.co/pdrH78wgLN

Text: @shujaxhaider It's musically pretty weak, but nonetheless, I'm surprised by and appreciate the sentiment, not often echoed by prominent mainstream comics.

Text: @shujaxhaider Hm, I read it a little differently, but nonetheless, I think even that would be a notable position among mainstream comics, relative to a kind of usual default NYT reverence.
