<pre>Over my years of stupidly being a mathematician, I&#39;ve found it&#39;s rarely the content that&#39;s hard to explain to lay ppl, so much as the point.</pre>

<pre>@ManCaveJokes That trick where the photo cuts off naturally at the top just before revealing his baldness? Pro move; surprisingly effective.</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 E.g., why care about primes, or rings, or graphs…? Well, they are well-situated, connection-wise, in the math landscape.</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 You could, and some do, but not as well-situated. Doesn&#39;t illuminate quickly much else in the web of math to date.</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 But just conveying definitions to lay ppl is actually oft not that hard (even for &quot;advanced&quot; topics), if no need to motivate!</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 Tl;dr: clearly, any bit of math had some point to the folks who studied it, and that&#39;s often the part that&#39;s hard to convey.</pre>

<pre>@CarlBeijer Huh. I feel like in our circles, ppl use &quot;left&quot; to mean socialist as opposed to liberal. But yes, always potential for confusion</pre>

<pre>@CarlBeijer Also confusing: many in mainstream using &quot;liberal&quot; to mean any of these; socialism as &quot;extreme liberals&quot; etc. Language is tricky</pre>
