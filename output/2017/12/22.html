Text: @sigfpe @jcreed @PLT_cheater Well, scalar + vector doesn't scale linearly with rescaling of vectors, but then, neither do area, or volume or such uncontroversially physically acceptable quantities. Each has its own way of rescaling, and so does scalar + vector.

Text: @sigfpe @jcreed @PLT_cheater corresponding tensor algebra automorphism of the tensor algebra over V.

[This also gets at the problem with Clifford algebras, which depend on a chosen inner product from grade 2 tensors to grade 0 tensors, which destroys the possibility of such rescaling automorphisms]

Text: @sigfpe Perhaps I have an overly narrow understanding of what "corecursion" means, but the naming always seems to me misleading, as corecursion is dual to primitive recursion (the morphisms to terminal coalgebras/from initial algebras, respectively), not to the general idea of recursion.

Text: @PLT_cheater Right, this is again the orbit of a point under a group action. It feels just like ordinary happily typed [addVectorToPoint v p | v &lt;- vectorSpace] in my mind, where p :: Point, v :: Vector, and Vector is something like Point -&gt; Point so that addVectorPoint v p = v p.

Text: @PLT_cheater I'm also sort of guessing at what the intent was, as I can't get "o = liftM2 takeWhile (/=) . iterate" to work properly. Was "o f x" supposed to produce, e.g., the same result as "let cutoff (start:rest) = start : (takeWhile (/= start) rest) in cutoff $ iterate f x"?
