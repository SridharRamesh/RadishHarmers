<pre>Everything feels disgusting when I&#39;m sick. Food, weather, even abstract concepts turn my stomach when sick. Parsimony? No thank you. Grimm&#39;s Law? Nauseating. A rectangle twice as wide as it is tall? Ugh, could the world not, I&#39;m trying to get better over here.</pre>

<pre>Good news. The latest research out of the CDC indicates the virus cannot infect those who&#39;ve never erred. It can only enter through small pores created by one&#39;s first mistake or sin; &quot;popping the regret cherry&quot; they call it. This should bring the rate of spread down considerably.</pre>
