[This also gets at the problem with Clifford algebras, which depend on a chosen inner product from grade 2 tensors to grade 0 tensors, which destroys the possibility of such rescaling automorphisms]</pre>

<pre>A Christmas Story is my favorite Groundhog Day movie.

This is a rote and mechanical tweet in a genre that was surely exhausted years ago, but also, I am convinced, of a certain optimality within its niche.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe Perhaps I have an overly narrow understanding of what &quot;corecursion&quot; means, but the naming always seems to me misleading, as corecursion is dual to primitive recursion (the morphisms to terminal coalgebras/from initial algebras, respectively), not to the general idea of recursion.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe That is, the naming is unfortunate in that I think most people would want to call corecursion a special case of &quot;recursion&quot;, as they ordinarily understand the term (the phenomenon of a function whose definition calls upon itself again).</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe Yeah, it&#39;s good to spread the word! I&#39;m also just doing my small part to help clear up what I&#39;ve found to be a common early confusion as to what corecursion amounts to.</pre>

<pre>@PLT_cheater Right, this is again the orbit of a point under a group action. It feels just like ordinary happily typed [addVectorToPoint v p | v &amp;lt;- vectorSpace] in my mind, where p :: Point, v :: Vector, and Vector is something like Point -&amp;gt; Point so that addVectorPoint v p = v p.</pre>

<pre>@PLT_cheater I&#39;m also sort of guessing at what the intent was, as I can&#39;t get &quot;o = liftM2 takeWhile (/=) . iterate&quot; to work properly. Was &quot;o f x&quot; supposed to produce, e.g., the same result as &quot;let cutoff (start:rest) = start : (takeWhile (/= start) rest) in cutoff $ iterate f x&quot;?</pre>
