<pre>I know, the phrase &quot;richest country in the world&quot; was mentioned. That&#39;s just a brute empirical fact being observed. (Yes, yes, &quot;brute empirical&quot; in another sense as well…). No one&#39;s saying &quot;Keep exploiting other countries!&quot;; they&#39;re just noting a cruel irony of life in America.</pre>

<pre>What&#39;s the point of this sort of clapback? Imperialism is evil; I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ll find everyone seeing any of these posts agree. Therefore, Americans SHOULDN&#39;T want or get free ambulances, as penance? Shouldn&#39;t talk about it? Everyone should have free ambulances, everywhere. https://t.co/yvSFgNis5J</pre>
