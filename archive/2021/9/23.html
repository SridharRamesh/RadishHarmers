<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is it because of the relationship to equilateral triangles? That is, is it just that 3 is the next small number after 2, for us to focus on 1/3 of a full turn [120°, and its supplements and complements]?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why is there so much talk about 30°-60°-90° triangles in high school or so? Is it just the fact that this is the only example of a rational angle with rational (co)sine? But so what? What does that matter for anything? Do these triangles actually show up in life especially often?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">But people never talk about 72° or 108° in these classes, as in 1/5 turns and regular pentagons. People talk about 1/3 turns, but everything falls of a cliff after that, nobody ever talks about 1/5 turns or 1/7 turns in these classes. What did 3 do to earn such attention?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@sarah_zrf Describing objects without morphisms is useless, but here&#39;s how I think of it: The objects are sets S along with a relation saying when a natural number witnesses that two values in S are equivalent. This relation has to satisfy a symmetry condition and a transitivity condition.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@sarah_zrf The symmetry condition is that there is a computable function which takes any witness for s = t to a witness for t = s.
