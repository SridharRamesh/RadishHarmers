<pre>@fauxletkult @athenogenes The more people telling such jokes, the better.

Your cooked brain may at least allow you to appreciate more of them than the average person. https://t.co/zwp0QjKrC6</pre>

<pre>@robinhanson Do you think circumstances under which you may only live near your family under pain of enslavement constitute extortion-free legitimate pressure? https://t.co/Mx6kpiTUJL</pre>

<pre>@robinhanson For Jefferson to offer only such constrained choices (without, say, &quot;Return home a free human being&quot; on the table, as Jefferson could as well grant) is extortion in itself. I seriously question your judgement on all issues relating to liberty if you cannot see this simple truth.</pre>

<pre>@robinhanson If I restricted myself to legal judgement on all concepts, I would have no grounds to oppose legalized and institutionally entrenched slavery, it&#39;s true. You will find the concept of extortion I am referencing in any dictionary, though; an ordinary language definition.</pre>

<pre>I&#39;m not one of those fools who assumes that just because I live in 2019, therefore 2019 is now. In 1880 they thought 1880 was now, and 1600 in 1600, and so on, all wrong. I&#39;ve got a feeling we&#39;re getting close, though. I bet now lies within the century. And here somewhere nearby.</pre>

<pre>What are you talking about? Vegetarian, maybe (though the majority of Indians aren&#39;t that either), but it&#39;s not at all an unreasonable question to ask if an Indian dish is made with cream or such dairy. https://t.co/a2qwL2q6zU</pre>

<pre>@zzararaii @finger_guns_bi To do shit like... ask what the ingredients in a dish are? I often ask such questions in restaurants, to make sure I don&#39;t eat things I wish not to eat. And sometimes, for reassurance, I even ask twice. Why shouldn&#39;t other people get to? Why are you so mad?</pre>

<pre>@zzararaii @finger_guns_bi People DO sometimes interpret words such as &quot;vegan&quot;/&quot;vegetarian&quot;/etc differently. Many times in my life, restaurant dishes called &quot;vegetarian&quot; have contained fish ingredients, which is not how I use the term. So sometimes I ask for clarification. Is it some grave sin to ask?</pre>
