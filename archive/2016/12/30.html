<pre>Luckily, a wider array of older films is available to rent to stream on Amazon. Not everything, not nearly so, but many more than Netflix.</pre>

<pre>Their labor practices are hell, and it&#39;s now impossible to buy ordinary consumer goods from them w/o worrying about fraud, knockoffs, etc.</pre>

<pre>&quot;Chick in the car and the car won&#39;t go&quot; makes sense, but &quot;Knife, fork, bottle, and a cork&quot; needs work. Take it from me, early 1900s children</pre>
