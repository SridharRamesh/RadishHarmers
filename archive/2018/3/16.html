<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m up to double-digit follower-losses in one day.<br><br>(On the rare occasions I&#39;ve pulled off the opposite, I&#39;ve felt like a God. This is all a burden for me to be aware of. Get me to the point where I can&#39;t see the least significant digits anymore.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’d get the fixation on π&#39;s digits if anyone had stuff to say about them, anything. But there’s only one thing to say (“They can&#39;t just cycle”), and that thing&#39;s better put in non-digit terms (“π&#39;s not x/y for whole x, y”), so the empty pop obsession with those digits frustrates.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Children are correct to be bored by recitations of memorized digits of π, and the like; to find it an uncompelling advertisement for mathematics. And those children who are into that stuff? They are incorrect.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(All my math tweets end up being about numbers and arithmetic, for natural but unfortunate reasons, perpetuating a rather narrow image of what math is. I wonder what the pithiest generally comprehensible thing about my actual field of logic that I could put in a tweet would be.)</p></blockquote>
