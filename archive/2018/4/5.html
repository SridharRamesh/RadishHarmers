<pre>@neyvay I hope to God there is video of this somewhere to put the Vengaboys over.

(Also, WTF? This tweet is criminally underappreciated right now. I expect to see this rectified by the morning, Twitter.)</pre>

<pre>The sex number? That&#39;s what I call condoms! Amirite, folks? Folks? Usually at this point in the tweet, something happens to cut me off, &quot;This is a job interview&quot;, something, anything. How have I been left to carry on? Wait, how has my character limit extended?! Oh god, stretch…</pre>

<pre>There&#39;s a knee-jerk tendency to take strangers at face value whenever they pop up in your timeline, no matter what they&#39;re saying, as long as what they&#39;re saying seems foolish; a rush counter to the traditionally theorized Gricean charity one would only summon for a friend.</pre>

<pre>@MarginalScribbl I suppose the US market overall might not be fond of the flavor, but surely the niche that supports it would still make it profitable? (Disclaimer: I have no idea how the chip business works.)

FWIW, I like all the other flavors India gets too, but that one is the greatest thing.</pre>

I guess the proper Indian soda thing you&#39;re supposed to have is Thums Up, instead of Coca-Cola. I don&#39;t care much for soda, so it&#39;s all whatever to me, but so folks say.</pre>
