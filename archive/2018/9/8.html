<pre>My lying cheating whore of an ex-wife. If only I&#39;d divorced her while I had the chance. If only I&#39;d foreseen she&#39;d have this affair with the local necrophile.</pre>

<pre>When I was in grad school, I always felt this immense time pressure around my thesis; like I was way overdue. Then Brian May and Dexter Holland and all of them just went back decades later and got their PhDs. The pressure&#39;s all made up. If you leave, you can finish whenever.</pre>

<pre>Well, as long as you play guitar, successfully enough to support yourself. (But that becoming a literal rock star part may well be easier and less delusionally luck-dependent than shooting for an academic career.)</pre>

<pre>If Montessori schools are so great, how come Maria Montessori herself chose not to attend one for her own childhood education? Pretty damning. There&#39;s nothing I hate more than hypocrisy.</pre>

<pre>Rest in peace, Burt Reynolds. You taught me it was ok to be a sexual icon for an entire generation of women.</pre>

<pre>A million years of evolution and a couple decades of cutting Internet commentary still haven&#39;t eradicated horniness? How embarrassing.</pre>

<pre>[As the waiter brings out my fajitas, still sizzling with heat]
There&#39;s been some mistake! This isn&#39;t ready yet. This is... my God, this is inedible. Take it back to the kitchen and only bring it to me when its preparation is complete.</pre>

<pre>&quot;Of course&quot;, noted Freud in setting out his theory, &quot;the ego&#39;s so full of itself, it thinks IT&#39;S the super-ego&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@matrix_reIoaded It really is. I can&#39;t figure out why it hasn&#39;t worked yet, what misplaced word or comma is the problem, but I&#39;ll make it work, goddammit.</pre>

<pre>@_shyextrovert @matrix_reIoaded No, no, it&#39;s become clear to me that the whole problem is that I&#39;ve said &quot;ego&#39;s&quot; instead of &quot;ego is&quot;. I will be deleting and re-posting shortly.</pre>

<pre>@KRASNEROCALYPSE 1729 as sex number? Can confirm; my long mid-coitus lectures on the significance of 1729 tend to numb the pleasures of sex for my partners.</pre>

<pre>Used to be that all comedians wanted to be musicians and all musicians wanted to be comedians. Now, all comedians want to be political firebrands and all journalists want to be comedians. (Also, all flight attendants want to be comedians, but that doesn&#39;t fit pithily into this.)</pre>

<pre>I saw another person with a piece of string tied around their finger, on my afternoon walk today. It cheered me up, to see I wasn&#39;t the only person who needed to remember to call the doctor to schedule a followup appointment for hemorrhoid surgery.</pre>
