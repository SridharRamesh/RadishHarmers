Text: RT @RadishHarmers: I was so much harder as a child. As an adult, if someone were to ever once make fun of me, I would instantly die.

Text: If I were a mouse, based on the information available to me from cartoons, I would gladly walk into mousetraps. What's a bit of mouse jail, against the reward of glorious cheese while there? It is for this reason older mice do not let younger mice watch cartoons, not even Mickey.

Text: The snicker becomes a chortle, and then a guffaw, and soon enough, I'm pissing myself laughing. ...What's this? The campmates awake from their pretend sleep, pointing and proudly giggling. Oh no! The prankster has become the prankee.

Text: And so you see, the phonetic similarity of "free speech" to the semantically unrelated, and indeed absurd, pair of words "freeze peach" reveals it to have been all along a groundless principle. (Hoist with its own speech petard, as it were.)

Text: An accurate and not at all disingenuous argument about history is that countering racism, sexism, homophobia, etc, requires trading away higher taxation and social spending, the welfare state, etc. Can't have one without the other. Welfare funding comes from homogeneity bucks.

Text: @k_shivers I just realized it's a couple months old (it had been retweeted into my timeline and I thought it was new). So, while it's still a dumb tweet, I feel like it's also dumb of me to waste time dunking on an old dumb tweet from a known dumb person. As you say, it's self-parodic..

Text: I don't like watching any movie or TV show about high school, because I was popular. My kind does not get a fair shake in Hollywood. (Sure, they let us in front of the camera, but never behind; writers' rooms fulminate against us for our crimes of being charismatic and friendly.)

There's been some mistake! This isn't ready yet. This is inedible. Take it back to the kitchen and only bring it to me when its preparation is complete.
