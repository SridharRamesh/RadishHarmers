Text: @BUSSCRO In earnestness, I recognized it's wiser to not be a part of trivial dumb outrage-hype cycles, than to be a part of them while claiming self-awareness about their nature.

In non-earnestness, I see nothing funny about this man's name, and frankly, am offended by your xenophobia.

Text: @magi_jay @BernieSanders This is the mildest of criticism. Not even criticism; disagreement. You asked a question about Bernie Sanders, and someone answered in a pro-Bernie, pro-poor people way, with no insult to you. They just thought he was good, while you think he is bad. How is this harassment?
