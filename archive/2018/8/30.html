<pre>They say Gros Michels taste way better than Cavendishes. I&#39;ll never get to tell, myself, but I&#39;ll bet they do. I&#39;ll bet they goddamn do. And yet… And yet… Even Cavendishes already taste amazing! (They topped that?) What a wonderful world! Ah, I&#39;m smiling just thinking about it.</pre>

<pre>That fable on the absurdly long spoons in Hell, everyone starving unable to eat, while in Heaven they get the same spoons but just feed each other. It&#39;s like that with everyone in the world being so harshly down on themselves, but (thankfully) boosting up their friends&#39; esteem.</pre>

<pre>Whenever I meet someone new, they can&#39;t shut up about C. V. Sridhar (22 July 1933 – 20 October 2008), giggling childishly. Like, I get it already! He was an Indian screenwriter and film director. He has directed nearly 60 films in Tamil, Hindi and Telugu.

<pre>@jcreed @sclv &quot;Anna&#39;s story is about my officemate in grad school… He was flying from London to the US right after the waterbombing incident.&quot; by David Zureick-Brown is reasonably specific, but I still doubt it. The incentives to embellish are too high, and the joke pre-exists too much.</pre>
