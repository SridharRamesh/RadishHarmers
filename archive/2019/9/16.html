<pre>Comedic portrayals of Hitler have been utterly mainstream for over half a century at this point, but to joke about the Holocaust itself remains largely off-limits. One must conclude that the dominant attitude among audiences is one of separating art from the artist.</pre>

<pre>2. Permutations carry parity (attributed to Cauchy in the early 1800s, but Cramer implicitly stumbled on the concept 70 years earlier). That is, for any arrangement of objects, swapping two at a time, one cannot return to the original arrangement in an odd number of swaps.</pre>
