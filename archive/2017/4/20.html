<pre>@jeffhubbs 2000 Nazis marched on Munich, killing 4 in attempted coup. Maybe 300 red hatters showed up in Berkeley to sneer taunts and seize a dumpster.</pre>

<pre>There IS a group in the US today which is racist, fascistic, and genuinely, alarmingly (murderously!) powerful: cops. Go brawl with them.</pre>

<pre>No? A tactic which only works against the already weak (and even there, only achieving limited victories…) is not a very impressive tactic.</pre>
