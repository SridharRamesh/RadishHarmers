Text: A 55 year old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28 year old with three PhDs. Especially smarter, because this idiot has been thinking about three things for the last fifteen years. Don't look up whose quip this is. It's a good observation.

Text: @silvascientist I don't believe I am. A garbage man has lived life freely thinking about a million things. A person with N PhDs has only thought about N things. Let me consult on the math with my co-writer and get back to you.
