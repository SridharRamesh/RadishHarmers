Text: Oh, it's to be a dick measuring contest, is it? Shit, you may as well pack your stuff up and go home now; I've won every dick measuring contest I've ever been a part of. I'm incredibly good at measuring dicks. My synthesis of accuracy and speed is nonpareil.

Text: I used to eat whatever, yet stay unduly skinny. As I enter middle age, it'll flip; I will grow the belly traditional to my people. Ergo, by the IVT, there must be a moment of achieving Goldilocks perfection. I hope I'm not stuck on a long phone call or in a work meeting that day.
