<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You want to express hateful disagreement with this country and the beautiful flag which symbolizes it? You want to foment that kind of anger and aggressive energy? Don&#39;t burn the flag. Wave a Red Bull in front of it. Flags hate that shit; they go nuts.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not sure if I&#39;m coming down sick or if it&#39;s just winter drying and chapping every last bit of me? The former would be better as more temporary, while the latter would be better as meaning things aren&#39;t just starting up, ramping into worse. Regardless, I inform my loyal followers.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank God O&#39;Rourke lost. It pains me to have to discuss this publicly, but (though he appears all sweet and nerdy on the outside) many years ago he held me down and MADE me cum until my calves cramped. It was awful and scarring and the man belongs in prison, not in Congress.</p></blockquote>
