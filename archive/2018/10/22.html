<pre>Twitter videos should keep playing audio even if you switch focus to another tab (just like YouTube or Netflix or any other thing). If I wanted to mute it, I&#39;d do it myself.</pre>

<pre>@Speediest_Sloth I did this often when character count was more limited on this site. It has now become just a quirk of my Twitter register I&#39;m stuck with, much like saying &quot;irk&quot; instead of &quot;annoy&quot;, &quot;fret&quot; instead of &quot;worry&quot;, &quot;ought&quot; instead of &quot;should&quot;, etc.</pre>

<pre>I can tell this pic is &#39;shopped from how many of the distinctive elements in its background are upside-down. A dead giveaway for an old pro like me! Oh wait— [Turns photo around in hands, but only 90°]. What the?! …Hm. [I keep turning back and forth, but just between these two].</pre>
