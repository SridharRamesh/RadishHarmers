Text: @sigfpe Personally, I'd say the code has meaning in itself, and if some compiler chooses to emit whatever, that's a fact about the compiler, not a fact about the code. That's an opportunity for me to judge the correctness of the compiler, not a mistake in my talking about the code.

Text: @sclv @sigfpe It's however granular you take it to be in considering the presumption "the effect of some code is defined and deterministic" to be in play. But there's generally implicitly some meaning to the language you're using, distinct from specifying what assembly the compiler outputs.

Text: @AliceFromQueens @BellaRudd1 A complete basket case could sell off food, even if given to them through food-only assistance. The solution to dealing with someone that mentally ill is specific treatment for their mental illness. But framing this as an objection to UBI seems to me bizarre.

Text: @AliceFromQueens @BellaRudd1 It's like objecting to SNAP itself because someone mentally ill might choose to load up on the wrong foods (even with all the existing SNAP restrictions) and not get a balanced diet.

Text: @AliceFromQueens @BellaRudd1 Someone who has regular income yet does not buy food is mentally ill in some fashion or another. They are displaying an extreme inability to take care of themselves. They need treatment.

Text: @AliceFromQueens @BellaRudd1 If UBI is paid on a frequent enough basis, there is no need to worry about saving it. But I don't really object to the idea that housing ought be detached from managing rent. It's bringing up things like SNAP in this context that seems to me bizarre.

Text: @BeatificKowboy @AliceFromQueens @BellaRudd1 I don't really know why I entered this conversation, but if you've paid attention to my tweets at all, you should have noticed that I have always, at all times, used this account for being a normal human being who has a multiplicity of thoughts, in addition to posting jokes.

Text: @shaylakraze @Sturgeons_Law In full disclosure, there's some more vague allegations beyond this about him not believing in white privilege and voicing stereotypes, but it's not concretely said what this was. I'll be honest, I take high schoolers as unreliable narrators for my coming to strong judgements.

As ever, I don't know why I'm bothering talking.)

Text: @ComradeLuanne I actually don't like this joke I've just made very much, both because it's obvious low-hanging fruit and played out Twitter bullshit, but also because I'm sympathetic to that post everyone hated. My serious answer is that I think most brains are normal. But that's not quippy.
