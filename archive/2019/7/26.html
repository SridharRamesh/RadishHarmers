<pre>@sclv Wait a couple months, and there will be some other occasion to post it. For that matter, wait a couple months, and there will be some other iteration of the &quot;Me in high school vs. Me now&quot; meme. This whole site is cyclic.</pre>

<pre>@sclv Oh, right! Pedantically, I was in my second month of college. But the Jared photo is played out, anyway. It needs to rest between outings.</pre>

<pre>@Styl_oh Honestly, no one here has enough context to understand. I went looking on FB for HS photos of me for the meme, saw these pics near each other (the 2nd from a sketch video) in roughly the same pose, wearing stripes, face turned away making the meme pointless, and found this funny.</pre>

<pre>I apologize. I didn&#39;t eat today, and therefore I was cranky. I will spend the next week eating. The week after that, I will sleep, and I&#39;m planning to round out the month with some bathroom functions whose details I save for subscribers.</pre>

<pre>@johncarlosbaez @JDHamkins @liuyao12 In general, the symmetry group of a regular n-gon will be noncrystallographic just in case the n-th cyclotomic polynomial has degree &amp;gt; 2, which will happen for n other than 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.</pre>

<pre>@johncarlosbaez @JDHamkins @liuyao12 Take a regular n-gon within a lattice. Its central point may not be a lattice point, but if we pick an arbitrary lattice point, we can scale everything up by a factor of n in terms of its displacement from this point, yielding a new regular n-gon whose center is a lattice point.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@johncarlosbaez @JDHamkins @liuyao12 This n-gons vertices can be considered as lattice vectors relative to its center. Relative to any one of these vectors, the other vectors are given by rotations corresponding to the complex numbers which are n-th roots of unity.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@johncarlosbaez @JDHamkins @liuyao12 Since all of these vectors are lattice vectors, so are arbitrary integer linear combinations of them. Thus, the entire ring of integer linear combinations of n-th roots of unity must form a lattice.</pre>

<pre>@johncarlosbaez @JDHamkins @liuyao12 So now the matter reduces to checking conditions under which this occurs.

This amounts to checking conditions under which this ring is &quot;2-dimensional&quot; over the integers, which amounts to looking at the degree of the n-th cyclotomic polynomial.</pre>

<pre>@johncarlosbaez @JDHamkins @liuyao12 The key lemma to see is that every lattice is isomorphic to the additive group Z^2. (I.e., every lattice has a &quot;fundamental pair of periods&quot;)

However, the ring generated by n-th roots of unity is isomorphic to Z^(ϕ(n)), with ϕ(n) as the degree of the n-th cyclotomic polynomial.</pre>

<pre>@ebarcuzzi In their defense, had I experienced tremendous success from a labor of love, I wouldn&#39;t spontaneously stop simply due to time passing either. I would not view myself, who I have been from birth and shall be decades hence, as obsolete.

But I&#39;m not them, so I can see them clearly.</pre>
