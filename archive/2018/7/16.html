<pre>The &quot;Couple of things…&quot; thread that went viral recently on Hindu vs. Nazi swastikas had a couple informative points for those unfamiliar with Hindu iconography, but also some outright falsehoods. Most of all, this immediately debunkable urban legend that yet refuses to die.</pre>

<pre>On the left, Hindu swastikas from the very example illustration given in that very thread! On the right, the personal standard of Hitler. Both un-tilted, both dot-less, and, contra what you&#39;ve repeated your whole life but never checked, both turning in the same exact direction. https://t.co/dVdvC2fSGq</pre>

<pre>Nazi swastikas are usually tilted 45°, and Hindu swastikas usually aren&#39;t, but neither is always true. Hindu ones often have 4 dots, but frequently enough just as well don&#39;t. And while both orientations are used throughout Asia and its various religions, I cannot repeat enough:</pre>

<pre>The actual distinction is that Hindu swastikas are used in conveying Hindu messages, while Nazi swastikas are used in conveying Nazi messages. If you want to know which you&#39;re dealing with, look at the use; don&#39;t look at some other thing. This is how everything works.</pre>

<pre>The brute empirical fact is that this symbol is both a Hindu swastika and a Nazi swastika. There needn&#39;t be any marking in the symbol itself to distinguish Hindu from Nazi use; such is magical thinking. I&#39;m not saying this because I want it to be so, but as brute empirical fact.</pre>

<pre>@royaltheartist Let me understand you correctly. Are you saying that you normally rhyme the word &quot;nice&quot; in &quot;Have a nice day&quot; with a word like, say, &quot;Greece&quot;? Do &quot;Have a nice day&quot; and &quot;Have a Greece day&quot; rhyme for you?</pre>

<pre>@royaltheartist @AllenVentano On the marginal off-chance that you&#39;re serious, no, I pronounce &quot;nice&quot; like &quot;ice&quot;. For me, &quot;Have a nice day&quot; is pronounced almost exactly the same as &quot;Have an ice day&quot;.

(There&#39;s a SLIGHT difference between these two for me, but not one relevant to the words &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;ice&quot;).</pre>

Alas, the restaurant business is much tougher than I realize. I only make it to &quot;ACC&quot; (Cathy voice), then go bankrupt.</pre>
