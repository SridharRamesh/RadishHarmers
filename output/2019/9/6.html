Text: @neoliberal_dad Yes, the main problem with the Facebook dating thing is remembering that neither I nor most people my age actually use Facebook anymore. And the ones who do? They are perhaps instantly marking themselves as not the same kind of person as me.

Text: You have to support the villains; the underdogs. Batman gets everything he wants: luxurious wealth, incredible gadgets, a 24/7 servant, freedom from his overbearing parents, and that souped up car. Some guys get all the luck.

Text: @WaywardWinifred @MorningConsult This chart is only showing that the percentage of Bernie supporters who are young is 20 points higher than the percentage of the next candidate's supporters who are young.
