<pre>@endlesswario It&#39;s an unfortunate setup. Even to say publicly the person one wishes to not have been cancelled (by virtue of wishing they hadn&#39;t done the thing they had been cancelled for, of course) still invites cancellation on the wisher. Too risky. You won&#39;t trip me up this way.</pre>
