<p>
<pre>@quasicoherence There&#39;s this big lie that math is done in ZFC, and that&#39;s not true if you look at mathematical practice. Math is done with what rules are directly relevant, and webs of connections are observed. There&#39;s no such thing as its assembly code. Only certain logicians care about ZFC.</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence Math from the 1800s carries over to the present, even though it wasn&#39;t formulated in ZF, and that&#39;s because it had nothing to do with ZF. It wasn&#39;t just some pre-formal inchoate attempt to write a proof only made proper within ZF. It was its own thing and lives on its own terms.</pre>
