<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a shitpost of course, but everybody gets silly about this.<br><br>Should 1 be prime? It&#39;s not a product of two smaller whole numbers. Should 0 be prime? It doesn&#39;t divide a product unless it divides one of the factors.<br><br>No. That would fail to cut at the joints. Here&#39;s why. https://t.co/GytEeFj9T8</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In general, it turns out whether two positive whole numbers have the same multiplication properties or not just has to do with their prime factorization. They have the same multiplication properties if each exponent appears the same number of times in their prime factorizations.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ZenoRogue It has caused unfortunate confusion that they happened to use the word &quot;prime&quot; for that. There&#39;s no preferential reason for them to have used the word for that instead of calling irreducible elements &quot;prime&quot; or various other equally plausible generalizations.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ZenoRogue It has led to so much substance-less pedantry about what &quot;prime&quot; really means. Whereas the pedantry I mean to draw attention to has some actual substance. The sense in which 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, … are all similar to each other and distinct from 0 or 1 is real and valuable.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@feedback_looper @JadeMasterMath You surely can&#39;t measure a merely by displacement from the floor, since the floor isn&#39;t part of the catenary&#39;s dynamics. You can raise the poles by any amount and the displacement from the floor goes up by that amount, without the chain itself changing shape.</p></blockquote>
