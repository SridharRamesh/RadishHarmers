Text: The year 2080. At last, everyone can code. Poverty still exists. If you wanted more money, you should've learnt a rare skill like driving.

Text: I waited till 1990, when You Can't Do That On Television went off air, to first say the words "I don't know". I also avoided the names of all liquids. My parents, worried by my late language development, arranged an aide who slowly taught me "water", The Miracle Worker style.

Text: The success of Columbus's journeys was not due to better information than his critics on Earth's shape, but rather, enormous luck regarding its size (to wit, that its western edge falls between Russia and Alaska, and not, as was scholarly opinion of the time, mid-Atlantic Ocean).

Text: DEBUNKING THE MYTH

Columbus, like most common men of his day, believed the world to be round. However, the well-educated had known even since antiquity, just as we now do, that the world is actually flat, as can easily be demonstrated by looking at any map.

Text: Of course I'm going to stay up late. Of course I'm going to deprive myself of as much sleep as possible, till barely bearable. Don't you know we have only a finite lifespan? Don't you want to get your money's worth, desperately grabbing onto all the consciousness you can?

Text: I only listen to two genres of music. Everything except country, or everything except rap, depending on my mood. Sometimes I listen to everything except country-everything except rap-fusion.

Text: The pattern continues up through 5,149,108,636, but then 5,149,108,637 is even and 5,149,108,638 is odd. Mathematicians couldn't notice before because computing technology only recently made the calculations feasible.

Text: As I recall, as is common with Netflix shows, the first season was more creative than later ones. But this is only a comment on the comedic quality. Ethically, it's all fine. To some extent, what makes later seasons less interesting is more Very Special Episode flavor.
