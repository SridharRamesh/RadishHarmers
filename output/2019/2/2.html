Text: I washed out of med school my second year. It had been my dream to be a doctor, but the exams were killer; I wasn't cut out for it. I tried and tried, but just couldn't keep straight all the JRPG characters' blood types.

Text: I hate when Twitter shows threads on the timeline silently removing intermediate posts, so it looks like people are directly responding to things they are not, in fact, directly responding to. C'mon! Just straight up make up the posts at that point. Whatever, I'll still use it…

Text: Money isn't a physical good; it's a relationship, of how others are to act. Folks talk about taxation like you're handing over bags of prized goods. That's not mainly it. It's just numbers in computers; it's just society opting to be less deferent to your will for how to run it.

Text: After several witnessed instances, it's especially clear most of what goes into any follower count is random luck, even for the best and most beloved; any popular poster experiences some major regression toward the mean upon leaving and returning anew. Just dumb capricious luck.

Text: @matrix_reIoaded You're in a desert, walking along, when you look down and see a tortoise. You flip it over on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over. But it can't. Not without your help. But you're not helping. You're not helping. Why is that?

Text: @Sturgeons_Law Huh, that's surprising to me. But (not having seen the research) I could imagine the reason being only that common stereotypes are more readily activated by commonly used terms than by uncommon ones, which would not ultimately be fixed simply by changing which terms are common.
