Text: @nancerayder @i_zzzzzz @boring_as_heck No one will care for my pedantry, but this isn't an icosahedron (20 faces). It's an icositetrahedron (24 faces). Specifically, a hexagonal antiprism (two hexagons plus triangles connecting vertices of either to edges of the other) whose hexagons are split into six triangles each.

Text: @nancerayder @i_zzzzzz @boring_as_heck A name for this specific 24-faced shape is the gyroelongated hexagonal bipyramid ("gyroelongated bipyramid" in general meaning taking an antiprism and splitting its two big faces into triangles around the center), but at some point, people stop naming and just describe, as above.

Text: @nancerayder @i_zzzzzz @boring_as_heck It is the dual polyhedron to this one. That is, it's what you get by turning all the edges in this sideways, so to speak, causing old vertices to become centers of new faces and old centers of faces to become new vertices. https://t.co/gazwDT7c7g

Text: @nancerayder @i_zzzzzz @boring_as_heck If the sculpture had been a gyroelongated pentagonal bipyramid instead, it would've been the familiar fully symmetric icosahedron. The difference is easiest to see in the front and back vertices, both of which here have six spokes instead of five.

Text: @nancerayder @i_zzzzzz @boring_as_heck I don't have any jokes about icositetrahedra. I wish they would hurry up and release a new shape.
