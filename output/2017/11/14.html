Text: @quasicoherence @sigfpe Right, but the probabilistic laws of QM are actually phrased probabilistically: there is probability X of such and such. The 2nd Law is phrased as a claim with certainty: entropy always rises. The more accurate(?) probabilistic claim is obscured; I'm not even sure what it is.

Text: @sigfpe @quasicoherence Well, QM isn't just complex probability (and Born's rule), abstractly. That's part of it, but as physical law, it's also some claims about how this relates to specific behaviors of specific physical particles.

Text: @FlatteringRam You could definitely learn C++ if you wanted to. But also, be aware, C++ is itself an obtusely designed language. It wasn't handed down by the gods or anything. It's natural to find it confusing; it has plenty of unnecessary confusion designed into it.
