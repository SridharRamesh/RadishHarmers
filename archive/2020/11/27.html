<pre>@DylanGelula We&#39;re only recent mutuals. You&#39;ll get Thanksgiving well-wishes from me next year.</pre>

<pre>Marie Kondo created the &quot;one of them has got to go&quot; meme. Remember? From a hundred years ago? Happy Thanksgiving.</pre>

<pre>Finding Benford&#39;s law in everything is the mathematician&#39;s version of finding the golden ratio in everything. Every cloud is your favorite shape if you squint.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe You&#39;re right, it&#39;s a little inapt. What I would say is this: Does Benford&#39;s law hold, or does &quot;the magnitude of the deviation from uniformity of log(X) modulo a relatively small quantity is not very large&quot; hold?</pre>

<p>
<pre>@sigfpe There&#39;s a sense in which these are equivalent, but the former phrasing suggests an actual process in nature generating log-uniform values (which can happen, that&#39;s one kind of distribution and sometimes the relevant one, but</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe there&#39;s no reason to expect everything to have that distribution as a general fact about nature or logic), while the latter phrasing encompasses what I feel is the reality:</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe That there&#39;s all kinds of distributions that look Benfordy to some degree of tolerance because lots of things look like lots of things at lots of scales.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@sigfpe How clear is it that these things should be thought of as specifically Benford and not log-normal, say? Perhaps the real law should be that we expect log-normality with large variance. Yet that&#39;s a different law.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe I feel like singling out this particular type of distribution and saying &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s a law, empirical data tends to be Benfordy. If it isn&#39;t, you should be suspicious&quot; is like saying &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s a law, numbers tend to be 3. If you see a number that isn&#39;t 3, be suspicious&quot;.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@sigfpe It&#39;s true, lots of numbers are 3, and if you go looking for 3s, you&#39;ll find them, but it&#39;s no general law about the nature of empirical data. That&#39;s just one thing that can happen. And if you really want to see 3s, you&#39;ll even see them where the thing is better described as Ï€.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed It looks like you allow 0-ary, 1-ary, and 2-ary branching, but don&#39;t care about order. So if we restrict to finite sets, this is the free symmetric monoidal category with an object X and maps from X^0, X^1, and X^2 to X.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed To allow infinite sets, we add that our symmetric monoidal category has infinitary monoidal products, in the natural appropriate sense.</pre>
