Text: I couldn't pronounce my name until rather late in life (among other issues, I couldn't make the "sh" sound until middle school, ultimately fixed by tongue surgery.). In retrospect, it's odd this wasn't a cause of more embarrassment. I should have been more embarrassed as a child.

Text: This tweet is a lie which struck me as a funny idea (though, ugh, "I'm not white, that's my whole set, just noting that I'm not white…" is a popular genre I find increasingly tedious. But I think there's still something funny to this idea.). The shameful truth is exposed below:

Text: Anecdotes aren't funny. Nothing funny has ever happened in real life. People should just make up jokes. I like it when a comedian is distinct from a tape recorder.

Text: @quasicoherence @_onionesque I believe Abel's proof just directly argues about permutations of five generic roots. One needn't have the general concept of a group to discuss this one specific group.

Text: @johncarlosbaez Sounds like you don't just mean ZF minus the axiom of infinity; rather, you mean ZF minus the axiom of infinity plus the negation of the axiom of infinity. (After all, any model of ZF is already a model of ZF minus the axiom of infinity.)

Text: @johncarlosbaez Yeah. I'm just being pedantic. When saying ZF - infinity is "basically the same as PA", this suggests a 1:1 correspondence between their models. But for this we'll need the former to only have models where all sets are hereditarily finite; otherwise the correspondence isn't full.
