<pre>I still don&#39;t really understand this whole thing, but @cutasterfee is good on here, he often makes me laugh, yet it seems like folks are constantly dicks to him for no reason, beyond that he wrote a book with a title? I don&#39;t fully get the dynamics of this site.</pre>

<pre>@boomfisted The &quot;Universal Society of Hinduism&quot; is just some puffed up group, though; it doesn&#39;t represent all Hindus&#39; views, not nearly so, nor deserve that kind of deference. Frankly, I feel that guy is often unduly thin-skinned about this sort of thing.</pre>
