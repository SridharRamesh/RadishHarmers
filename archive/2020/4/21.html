<pre>@vanillaEQraider Season 3 just came out. Season 2 is insane. It&#39;s where my sense of the ambition of the show completely blew up.</pre>

<pre>@3hotpeople Like many of my posts, this does not express my sincere opinion. For what it&#39;s worth, I tend to work within classical logic fairly rarely. You may be the target audience for this. https://t.co/TTvXTh9Pfh</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe It becomes perhaps more vexing if phrased as:

N₁: The natural number defined as 1 + N₂, or 0 if N₂ isn&#39;t well-defined.
N₂: The natural number defined as 1 + N₃, or 0 if N₃ isn&#39;t well-defined.
N₃: The natural number defined as 1 + N₄, or 0 if N₄ isn&#39;t well-defined.

<pre>@sigfpe Intuitionistic logic would allow escape from that, but not from defining each C_k as the well-founded set of things successfully defined by C_i for i &amp;gt; k, as indices range over the natural numbers. A sort of variant presentation of Burali-Forti.</pre>
