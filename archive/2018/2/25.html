<pre>RT @RadishHarmers: ðŸŽ¶ Lolly, Lolly, Lolly, get your adverbs here.
Lolly, Lolly, Lolly, got some adverbs here.
Lo-lee. Lo. Lee.
Lo, plain Lo,â€¦</pre>

<pre>@cbarrett @madsamarxist Boys, boys, there&#39;s no need to fight: Surely linear algebra is part of abstract algebra, and as category-theoretic as everything else:</pre>

<pre>@cbarrett @madsamarxist Ringoids are categories enriched multifunctorially over Abelian groups (themselves (2, 2)-categories with single 0- and 1-cells), and linear algebra is essentially ringoid theory, particularly with a focus on ringoids where all nonzero morphisms are invertible.</pre>

<pre>@cbarrett @madsamarxist I realize this will be unconvincing to anyone not already fond of category theory, but I have personally found category theory indispensable in understanding linear algebra; understanding tensor products via universal mapping properties, say, and so on.

Anyway, back to fighting.</pre>

<pre>@madsamarxist @cbarrett Differential geometry is good. (I wish I knew more of it. Alas, life is finite and we are forced to specialize. There will be time somedayâ€¦)</pre>

<pre>@madsamarxist @cbarrett Yeah, a differentiable manifold is the general structure on which you can take derivatives. So that&#39;s a kind of computation, right? It&#39;s the eponymous calculus.</pre>

<pre>@madsamarxist @cbarrett Or, rather, computation/calculation in general is the eponymous &quot;calculus&quot;, and this is the archetypal calculus, or something.</pre>

<pre>@cbarrett @madsamarxist Sure, I&#39;m curious, though I don&#39;t mean to be bothersome; in the end, this is just a fun discussion about what subjects we each individually do and don&#39;t care for, in our own tastes. But I&#39;ll DM you out of curiosity.</pre>

<pre>@madsamarxist @cbarrett Anyway, I think of differential geometry as something like &quot;linear algebra on non-linear spaces&quot;. &quot;Locally linear algebra&quot;. Things like that. And since linear algebra is cool (as a special case of abstract algebra being coolâ€¦), so is this.</pre>

<pre>@madsamarxist @cbarrett The categorical perspective is that the derivative is a functor from the category of differential manifolds with a chosen point to the category of vector spaces, taking each manifold to the tangent space around the point and each map to its linear action between tangent spaces.</pre>

<pre>@madsamarxist @cbarrett And the right definition of a differential manifold is whatever it takes to get this. The right definition of a differential manifold is to say &quot;We have a category of differential manifolds, with this structure (and whatever else we want)&quot; by fiat.</pre>

<pre>The man in my mirror disgusts me. I paid good money for this highly polished surface to admire my lovely bathroom walls in, but he stands in way, blocking my view, smirking upside-down with glee. He is a dextrocardial freak, an abomination, and I dearly wish for God to kill him.</pre>

<pre>Drawing out a diagram to determine the genotype and phenotype frequencies for the offspring of It girls and IT guys. Calling it a Punnett square for obvious reasons.</pre>
