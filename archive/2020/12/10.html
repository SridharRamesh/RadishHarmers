<pre>@SimonCharlow SKI actually has some naturality to it, it arises very naturally in turning the lambda calculus into combinators. And similarly for thinking of B, C, W, etc, as you say. I&#39;m not quite taken with putting everything into combinator terms but it can at least be done with naturality.</pre>

<pre>@SimonCharlow But that&#39;s all way better than stuff like that linked Wolfram supercombinator, or sorry to say, your advisor&#39;s super combinator. All the single combinator systems really have no naturality at all. Even the trick of turning I into S K anything pushes us rather into trick-land.</pre>
