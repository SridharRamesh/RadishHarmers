Text: I treat my posts as my forebears (the American Indians) treated the buffalo, frugally wringing as much value out of each as possible, not a bit to waste. My endless retweets are out of respect for the American Indian. To reject them is to spit upon the American Indian.

Text: Milk handily turns undeniably foul long before becoming unhealthy to drink. Other foods lack such well-designed early warning systems. Some take advantage of this. They eat cheese and the like; they do not stop. They are mocking God's design. They are spitting in God's face.

Text: I will never eat a fruit without washing it first, the ritual firmly ingrained in earliest childhood. Not even an orange. Not even a banana. Hand me an unwashed fruit to eat and I'll slap that shit to the ground like it's arsenic. If you hand me washed arsenic, that'd be alright.
