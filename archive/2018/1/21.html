<pre>Gaming? Listen, I know gaming. I was a big gamer in high school. Huge. Everyone recognized my prowess. As I walked the halls, they&#39;d yell out &quot;You&#39;re such a Game Man! Get load of the Game Man, everybody!&quot;, as well as some constructions that didn&#39;t make grammatical sense or parse.</pre>

<pre>@KRASNEROCALYPSE Being an Indian into comedy has not been replete with strong models to look up to. There was one who was the bane of my college experience; who everyone mentioned to me constantly at the time, and who my Desi buddies couldn&#39;t get enough of. I went to college from 2003 to 2006.</pre>
