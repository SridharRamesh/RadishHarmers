Text: The Hilaria Baldwin story is all a big misunderstanding. It's just one of those things like how there's a Toledo, Ohio. There's also a Boston, Spain.

Text: @sigfpe This fiddly Chinese remainder theorem thing is such a tossed off afterthought in Gödel's 1931 paper, as he does not primarily work within first-order Peano Arithmetic axiomatized only in terms of plus and times. He works primarily in the richer system of Principia Mathematica.

Text: @sigfpe Yet everyone makes such a big deal of it now. When of course, even if it weren't available, people would instead just consider Peano Arithmetic axiomatized with exponentiation made directly available alongside addition and multiplication.

Text: @pervognsen @sigfpe This too is obvious in our world of computers. If numbers and bitstrings and text strings are all the same, well, no one ever finds it shocking you can write a pair of strings as suitably escaped or interleaved text itself. Even non-mathematicians find ways to do it all the time.

Text: @Culver33550336 @sigfpe It's precisely the opposite. The core Incompleteness argument is a (modalized) liar's paradox thing that seems too simple and airy-fairy. While technicalities about numeric encoding schemes and prime numbers seem like hard capital-M math, so they must be the main accomplishment.

Text: @sigfpe To be clear, no great fiddliness would be necessary if one had the function 2^N available already. Then one could easily extract the Nth bit of a number, yielding the correspondence between numbers and finite sets of numbers, and thus between numbers and hereditarily finite sets.

Text: @sigfpe I see a number of other replies say the surprising noteworthy thing is that our formal rules of inference can be reduced to arithmetic things. But this ought not be some surprising thing on top of the arithmetic encoding of sets of numbers as numbers.

Text: @sigfpe Once you can express the theory of hereditarily finite sets, you are essentially working in ZFC sans Infinity. No one finds it so surprising that we can define things in ZFC. It should be no surprise at all that we can define any formal symbol-manipulation process we like in ZFC.

Text: @instascat This actually works perfectly even for this discrete problem, thinking of this hundred point sum as a midpoint Riemann sum (or as a trapezoidal Riemann sum), since the series is affine. More generally, one would need Euler-Maclaurin correction between the discrete and continuous.

Text: @instascat So if we think of integrating the function x using a Riemann sum, we might note 1 as the average value of x over the unit interval from -0.5 to 1.5, 2 as the average value of x over the unit interval from 1.5 to 2.5, and so on. These averages are exact, by convenient affineness.

Text: @instascat Thus, we can conclude 1 + 2 + ... + 100 is exactly equal to the integral of x from -0.5 to 100.5.

Text: @instascat If the function had not been exact, then a thought like "The average value of the function over a small interval is well-approximated by the function's value at the midpoint of the interval" would need correction.

Text: @instascat But in this case, the same thought that lets us know the exact average over a unit interval would also just as directly tell us the exact average over the entire interval. So it's simpler than all that integration as such.

Text: @instascat So simple I expect many children would find the solution to this of their own accord, just as simply as Gauss supposedly did.
