<pre>Strong chance that by end of year, I&#39;ll have been on four different health insurance plans. In the meanwhile, I delay seeking treatment for things in the hopes I can avoid having to pay multiple deductibles. (This may end up foolish, but what comprises wisdom is hard to predict.)</pre>

<pre>@MurrayOverboard Deleting the existing tweets of the people that got banned is particularly infuriating to me. There&#39;s so much history wrapped up in those things! Even those of us unbanned have so many conversations interleaved with those, now illegible! And favorite remembered tweets, and so on.</pre>

<pre>The number of people banned is incredible. And still more every day. Fucking hell.

I&#39;d be curious to see a list not just of who all was banned, but what their original offenses were in each case.</pre>

<pre>Even as Twitter crumbles, I can&#39;t switch to Mastodon at this point. I&#39;m too old, too set in my ways; an ancient creature who will ultimately disappear due to inability to adapt to my changing environment. Alas, there is no site for people like me.</pre>

<pre>@ephemeralforms I 100% agree. I understand some of the mindset that motivated that design, but clearly, some schism between popular instances will eventually come, and then Mastodon will suffer the same kind of fate that&#39;s playing out here now.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@ephemeralforms Yup, this is the other thing: even apart from schisms, there&#39;s nothing making Mastodon admins any less likely to ban your friends in the long run. It&#39;s got exactly the same design risks around that as Twitter, save for not being popular yet.</pre>
