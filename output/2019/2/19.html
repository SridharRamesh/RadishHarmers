Text: A group of white men is called a "gaheemor". I don't know where everyone got this "podcast" business. I'm looking at the dictionary right now, and it says it's "gaheemor". Is this a US vs British thing? Huh, no, it lists the Commonwealth spelling too; "gaheemour". Mandela effect?

Text: @samueldkao @athenogenes We would be immeasurably poorer if Harvard and MIT were ever to join into one larger University of Cambridge. The organizational labeling distinctions are fundamental to innovation, and we must never allow socialism to take that from us.

Text: Bernie Sanders' brother sharing a name with a TV show and being a politician in his own right are both interfering with my ability to do the "I don't understand why everyone's so mad at Larry Sanders all the time. The fuck did he do? He's not even the one running" joke I want to.

Text: Well, someone surely already did it anyway, three to four years ago. Low-hanging fruit; I must push myself to stretch my muscles more. Wait, did I do this one before? Maybe I'll dig it up and self-retweet it.

Text: Class-first leftists show their true colors supporting Bernie Sanders, a candidate I do not and cannot endorse. The man has racism deep in his blood; as I understand it, close relatives were involved in the Holocaust.

Text: Oh God. Oh my God. I've just about had it up to here with John Wayne, having unearthed yet another disturbing little-known article, revealing his sexual assault, torture, and murder of at least 33 teenage boys and young men between 1972 and 1978 in Cook County, Illinois.
