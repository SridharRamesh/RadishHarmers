<pre>@marx_knopfler I looked at this diagram, then made sure to process it in a way that would result in my feeling fine instead of being upset.</pre>

<pre>Granted, I could just as well have done that with regard to the quoted post itself. And I have. Everyone is saying reasonable things from different contexts, with different emphases. It&#39;s all fine. I just thought I&#39;d make my play on the Twitter trope, as the opportunity arose.</pre>

<pre>@evanewashington This isn&#39;t the right analogy, because this doesn&#39;t match how second-order, third-order, etc logic are defined.</pre>

<pre>@evanewashington The type of truth values is of level 0, and the type of individuals is of level 1. A product of types has as its level the maximum of its factors&#39; levels, and the arrow type A -&amp;gt; B has as its level max(1 + level of A, level of B).</pre>

<pre>@evanewashington In Nth order logic, you can quantify over things of level ≤ N. Also, in Nth order logic, you can normally talk about things of level ≤ N + 1, EXCEPT, in zeroth order logic, you can&#39;t talk about individuals, even though they&#39;re level 1.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@evanewashington Maybe there&#39;s some slight tweak to this to make it cleaner. The &quot;You can talk about&quot; thing is a little fuzzy, it&#39;s not entirely clear what kinds of things people mean for you to be able to talk about even if you can&#39;t quantify over them in &quot;Nth order logic&quot;.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@evanewashington Generally, the only reason to talk about things that you can&#39;t quantify over is to apply them as predicates to the things you can quantify over. But eh. I would not have fixated on this particular ranked hierarchy thing as so important.</pre>

<pre>@evanewashington It&#39;s usually that one is interested in either propositional logic, first-order logic, or logic with the full power of function types or power types, not limited by some level scheme.</pre>

<pre>@evanewashington Sorry for making this a long thread. Twitter is terrible for discussing anything that wants to be a paragraph or so instead of two sentences. And generally, when I discuss math/logic/etc, I feel paragraph-level discussion is what is called for.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@evanewashington Actually, maybe I should make the type of truth values of level 1 above, and just say that calling propositional logic &quot;zeroth order logic&quot; is a complete exception to the otherwise rules.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@evanewashington After all, one cannot quantify over functions from truth values to individuals in intuitionistic first-order logic. Function types with truth values as the domain reduce to other things classically, but are not so trivial intuitionistically.</pre>

<pre>Page count isn&#39;t the relevant metric, it&#39;s far from the actual measure of completion, but it&#39;s the easiest metric to see. 

Eight pages in ten weeks. Pathetic. But eight beats eight lower numbers. If I had started doing this at the start of the pandemic, I&#39;d be done by now. https://t.co/1iM8zT8ZZa https://t.co/KAi6yL9Ff3</pre>

Sketches are meant to be viewed rather than read, but if you are the sort of person who would enjoy reading a sketch, please tautologically enjoy. https://t.co/dT1s1V7dzG</pre>
