Text: @flourmelon @L4NZHAN Right, their places of articulation are very close. The other difference is the manner of articulation, that "th" (voiced or unvoiced) is a fricative, while /t/ and /d/ are stops. Hence, the name "th-stopping" often used for this phenomenon.

I yearn to feel the warmth and security of community, accepted as I am, yet only express my fears by proxy as wit.

Text: Everyone writes, and is incentivized to write, pop math all wrong. "How mindblowing", "How wild". If you've known a bit of math for years and still find it mindblowing, you've not done a good job knowing it. The point of math is to understand things with clarity, not be dazzled.

Text: @deadpixels9 @silvascientist The way people talk about e^(i*pi) + 1 = 0 with awed mysticism is perhaps the single biggest example of what annoys me, yes.

Text: @HashtagShrid I like showing how two initially-seemingly unconnected things are connected, so long as it is done in such a way as to convey the ultimate clarity of this new understanding, not to convey mere awed mysticism that a connection could exist at all.

Text: @HashtagShrid "Here's a fun puzzle you don't yet understand, a surprising connection, but trust me, by the end of this explanation, you will slap your head with a smile at how simple and even retroactively obvious the connection is. So clear, you'll never forget how it works going forward.".

Text: @HashtagShrid A magic trick, but the thing that's fun should be understanding the trick and thus ending the puzzlement.

I find most pop math hits the wrong emphasis, emphasizing the initial confusion and not the ultimate clarity. I don't care about being fair to it.

Text: @hexcrimes @deadpixels9 @silvascientist The way every single person in the universe discusses this, including the Numberphile video that originally blew this up into an online phenomenon and then all the pedantic mathematicians who tut-tutted it as not True Summation responded, annoys the shit out of me.

Text: @hexcrimes @deadpixels9 @silvascientist The only two people I've ever seen discuss this without annoying me are me (e.g., https://t.co/SwYmJc8C5I) and midlife crisis sexy mathematician Ed Frenkel (in a followup Numberphile video much better than the one by the Numberphile guy himself).

Text: @hexcrimes @deadpixels9 @silvascientist There's also a discussion of related interesting math I gave at https://t.co/4qVtYRDe0q, though that's not oriented towards laypeople and not oriented towards clarifying the questions around what counts as True Summation, blah blah, which is really what the much ado was about.

Text: @nptoast Yes, this is the right state to reach with mathematics. The goal is to find new perspective to make ever more things understood so simply that they become, in retrospect, trivial and obvious and unawed, just as children understand counting.

Text: @nptoast The shift in perspective is fun, the way it is fun to look back and see how you have grown taller or gained muscle over the years, or the way it's fun to learn how a magic trick is done, but it should be fun because of the ultimate clarity, not in emphasis of the initial mystery.

Text: @nptoast The ultimate understanding reveals that the initial confusion was mistaken. To keep emphasizing the mystery ("Oh, what a wild coincidence that e^(i * pi) + 1 = 0, we will never understand such beauty", that sort of thing) is mysticism.

Text: The point of math is to understand things with clarity, not to be dazzled with preserved feelings of confusion. There must be better ways to make an idea interesting than to feign (or even convince yourself) it is beyond understanding transparently.

Text: @sigfpe @hexcrimes @deadpixels9 @silvascientist Oh, I forgot about that. That's also quite good, for understanding the technical result. Though it doesn't set itself to discussing the questions around what summation means, that were the heart of the online "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + … = -1/12 ??" controversy that blew up years later.

Text: @sigfpe @nptoast Yup, exactly. That's how I feel. And even where there is genuine mystery, the goal is to resolve (i.e., eliminate) the mystery.

Text: @sigfpe @nptoast There are many things I don't understand in math, some even that no one understands yet, and that is interesting, but as a challenge. If I knew they would never be understood, that there was no pithy story to discover and tell, I'd lose all interest entirely.
