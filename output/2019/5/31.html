Text: I scored in the 1100s on the SAT. Such a culturally biased test. Those 400 points you get for spelling your name right are harder for some of us than others.

Text: The only things I want to do at this point are have a family, retire, and die. The milestones. Everything else feels like shameful procrastination. For that matter, it would be nice if my kids hurried up and gave me some grandchildren; I won't be around forever, you know.

Text: Sometimes people say compliments to me and it's very nice; it's kind and feels great. But I feel like I rarely say compliments to others, even people I like. I should make myself say more compliments. I should allow myself to be sincere or even cornily so a couple times a month.

Text: @Vada_Yakshi Aw... In fairness, I suspect the majority of STEM people have never thought about the things I'm mentioning either. I'm making a joke about a controversy over how grade school multiplication is taught, but part of the joke is that I'm referencing more esoteric and advanced math.

Text: @Vada_Yakshi The other part of the joke is that this controversy is framed as though kids are multiplying too slowly. But I'm noting that nobody hand-multiplies in ways that're theoretically much more efficient, and there's no reason to drill any of this anyway; that's what computers are for.

Text: @icedteacommie My guess is that it started because they're nerds focused on maximizing their grades type shit, for the usual reasons behind that, and now it's also just self-sustaining because they see and know other Indians doing it.

Text: @icedteacommie Yeah. Presumably those organizations exist because of the same factors. I remember going to one Indian spelling bee thing as a child; very small scale, but it left me with one funny/striking memory about the competitiveness of the parents, but I'll tell the story some other time.
