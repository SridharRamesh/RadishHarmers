Text: @AntiFashGordon I feel like you're imagining a checkmark to do way more than a checkmark does. Anyone who'd be looking for a checkmark and notice its absence is studious enough to tell the difference between different accounts anyway. It's a silly system which marks official clout, nothing more. https://t.co/0DFvitr9XQ

Text: @AntiFashGordon I will say, and this will come across oddly but it's true, I regret that I quote-tweeted instead of screenshotting, because it was not my intention to cause her distress, even though I did feel there was something silly in the checkmark plea worth noting for a different audience.

Text: @AntiFashGordon I don't find her being harassed funny, and I wish it to end. It's the incongruity between the described scale of the problem (Nazis) and described scale of solution (a Twitter checkmark) which struck me as silly. But I will re-think about whether this was wrong to find silly.
