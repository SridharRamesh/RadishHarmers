<pre>Every movement has some stupid people, because stupidity is the norm. Some nobody being stupid hardly discredits the big picture, as the right-wing narrative seeks to paint.

That all said, it&#39;s quite funny how the energy left the crowd at &quot;We don&#39;t want your fucking taqueria&quot;. https://t.co/RT3EC7yxAG</pre>

<pre>@black_ops_post I think the way people frame and direct energy on gentrification is often hopelessly misguided and this is an example of that. A Mexican family owning a taqueria is fine and some white people eating tacos in Brooklyn is also fine. Neither of those have done something wrong.</pre>

<pre>@black_ops_post These guys aren&#39;t the landlords. I am willing to change my mind if it turns out these motley taco eaters are a consortium of landlords. But frankly, I&#39;ll eat my hat if the guy yelling at them has been in Brooklyn much longer than the restaurant.</pre>
