Text: Lyft charging a boatload extra (more than the original ride) for ride cancellations if it's been too long since you hailed the ride is aggravating design. Yeah, I'm cancelling BECAUSE my ride never showed up, and continues never showing up. That's a very natural reason to cancel!

Text: @quasicoherence Indeed, I did, but this is a not rare occurrence (just this morning, the other passenger in my Lyft line noted they had just had to cancel twice for the same reason, and the automated system would only refund them the first time), suggesting poor design evidenced here.

Text: @quasicoherence Had I just cancelled earlier, there'd have been no problem, but of course, the sole reason for my cancellation was the length of time since hailing without arrival.

Text: @GodoPal It's called somf (I dunno how to spell it…), and mostly fennel. It's alright. It's not my favorite, but some go nuts for it. It's like an after dinner mint.

Text: @GodoPal I fear I have made a fool of myself with my sincere answer. Listen to the advice to eat the whole bowl, and also, the spoon itself. (Avoid the fennel bits, though.)

Text: Consider …999, extending infinitely left (mirroring how 0.999… extends infinitely right).

In calculating …999 + 1, the first digit rolls over to 0, the carry causes the next digit to roll over to 0, and so on ad infinitum, in a chain reaction eventually making each digit 0.

Text: Thus, in some sense, …999 + 1 = 0 and thus in some sense …999 = -1.

In similar senses, clearly, 9 + 90 + 900 + … = …999 = -1, and, dividing through by 9, we have 1 + 10 + 100 + … = -1/9.

Text: Of course, in other more familiar senses, we'd instead say 1 + 10 + 100 + … = +∞. And nothing's wrong with that.

Text: But still, in different natural contexts and interpretations, we may wish to say 1 + 10 + 100 + … = -1/9.

In dealing with odometers or other such semi-cyclic phenomena, for example, it can be useful to think of 1 + 10 + 100 + … this way.

Text: This is how everything goes in math. It is all context- and sense-dependent.

We can pick at any moment which patterns we are interested in exploring, to better understand which other patterns or extramathematical applications. Nothing is handed down fixed from on high.

Text: @ModelOfTheory And what are those reasons? The main one I can think of is that the complex primitive n-th root of unity is an integer for n = 2, but not for higher n (and whatever consequences this has). Are there others?

Text: @ModelOfTheory I suppose there's also the fact that all nonzero values are equal in mod 2 land, but not higher mod p land (and whatever consequences this has).
