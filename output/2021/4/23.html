Text: As the inventor of The Office, I get a frankly insane amount of dating app strange. It doesn't hurt that I also created Parks and Recreation. I am Greg Daniels or possibly Michael Schur and I exist in ceaseless sexual ecstasy.

Text: I was gifted and I'm sad. I was gifted a platinum watch fob by my loving wife, who sold her very hair for it. And I'm sad because, alas, I'd pawned my watch, to buy her ornamental combs. I'm sad that she has beaten me in this exchange, her hair already starting to grow back.
