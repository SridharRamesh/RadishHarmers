<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@flglmn &quot;The&quot; problem is usually phrased in a loose way which doesn&#39;t pin down what math question precisely is being asked, so everybody goes insane because they all assume their own differing interpretations of what the math question is supposed to be, and then yell at each other.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@flglmn It doesn&#39;t help that folks think there&#39;s something called &quot;probability&quot; beyond just talking about proportions or frequencies. If the askers were clear about exactly what frequency ratios they are asking for under what assumptions, it would be simple counting with no controversy.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@Discourse_Jeb @flglmn Yes, exactly. The whole thing is asking questions with ambiguous wording or ambiguous setups, then yelling at people for not magically intuiting what you meant.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@Discourse_Jeb @flglmn With the dice question, people often ask an essentially identical probability question about boy/girl stuff in two-children families, same deal. But they do it with such terrible wording. The very wording is more messed up than any response people give.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@Discourse_Jeb @flglmn People say things like &quot;Given that one of the dice comes up 1, what is the probability that the other die comes up 1?&quot;. They mean for you to interpret this as &quot;Out of all the times when at least one of the two dice comes up 1, what proportion of the time do both dice come up 1?&quot;.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@Discourse_Jeb @flglmn But phrasing this in the language of &quot;the other die&quot; is misguided, in a scenario where two dice may both come up as 1, with no designation of which die is this one vs. which die is &quot;the other die&quot;. It is not sensible to use that language here.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@Discourse_Jeb @flglmn So it is very natural for the askee to interpret the questioner as asking some different question for which such language makes more sense. The questioner is in no place to be smug about it. It&#39;s their own damn fault.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@Discourse_Jeb @flglmn The counting questions are simple and uncontroversial, if asked clearly. It&#39;s all just being smug about dumb misguided language, questioners being smug about their own failure to appreciate ambiguities.<br><br>Please kill me. https://t.co/bHkMfeQLuJ</p></blockquote>
