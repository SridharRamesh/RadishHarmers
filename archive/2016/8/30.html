<pre>@portmanteauwar This is the only good Gene Wilder tweet I&#39;ve seen.</pre>

<pre>e^20 = ...27197858457785818756568221.0

Proof: check ln(this) = 20 by calculating (this^ε - 1)/ for ε ≈ 0; i.e., with many initial 0 digits.</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 It&#39;s real math, but presented in a deliberately surprising &amp;amp; coy way; thus perhaps amusing? A joke now, &amp;amp; later just a fact.</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 &quot;That&#39;s obviously not true; any calculator will tell you e^20 = 485165195.41... What could you mean? Oh... Oh, that&#39;s cute!&quot;</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 But, yes, understanding the backwards notation is a good start. Perhaps you&#39;ve seen it noted before that ...999.0 = -1?</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 That&#39;s right, but you may prefer to think in terms of rings of modular arithmetic.</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 Specifically, consider the categorical limit of Z/10^nZ (with obvious quotient maps between these).</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 Right. Great. Ok, so how might you notate a 10-adic value? A certain &quot;backwards&quot; notation seems apropos...</pre>

<pre>How to talk to a girl with headphones on:
1) Wear headphones
2) Talk to a girl (presumably, one who isn&#39;t wearing headphones herself)

Easy!</pre>

<pre>@RadishHarmers Argh, no Tweet editing. Should say &quot;(this^ε - 1)/ε&quot; for ln(this) calculation, of course.</pre>

Some coincidence that these all look so similar.)</pre>
