<pre>@puledipuledi There&#39;s no particular reason to expect general empirical data to be log-uniform at all. The same people who say this stuff also go around saying everything is normally distributed at other times, or everything is uniform. These are all very different distributions.</pre>

<pre>@puledipuledi Some &quot;law&quot;. It&#39;s no law, it&#39;s a kind of distribution, that some things sometimes come close to if you squint your eyes, like seeing the golden ratio everywhere. There&#39;s no reason to expect general empirical data to be log-uniform rather than any other distribution.</pre>

<pre>@puledipuledi It depends on the data. People try to convince themselves there&#39;s some simple law they can apply in general, without having to know anything or almost anything about the particular data-generating process. But it doesn&#39;t actually work that way.</pre>
