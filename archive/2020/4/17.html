<pre>@wokeberia And another way to see that this is different from analytic continuation, indeed the best way, is to note that all of this works just as well when our functions have discrete domains.</pre>

<pre>@wokeberia I hinted at this in https://t.co/S6dEb5PJNB, but elided getting fully into it in the space of tweets. But the notion of derivative we need isn&#39;t of infinitesimal rates of difference. All we actually need is information about the total differences of a function over each interval.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@wokeberia Similarly, the only notion of second derivative we need is information about the difference of differences over each pair of intervals of the same length. And so on. So we are only working with the calculus of finite differences.</pre>

<pre>@wokeberia This strengthens the results from what they might&#39;ve been thought to be too; e.g., when we say there is a unique pseudopolynomial satisfying a given recurrence, this even means that there is a unique such pseudopolynomial on a domain such as the integers and half-integers.</pre>

<pre>@wokeberia You needn&#39;t think about any other values to see that (1/2)! should be what it should be; you can calculate its value directly in this fashion without invoking any continuum.</pre>

<pre>Coronavirus accomplished so much of what Democrats sought for so long. Made it so no one dared visit a doctor for any ailment that wasn&#39;t coronavirus. But what they never anticipated, the monkey&#39;s paw-curl, was that more people than ever would be visiting doctors for coronavirus.</pre>
