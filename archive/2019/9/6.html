<pre>You have to support the villains; the underdogs. Batman gets everything he wants: luxurious wealth, incredible gadgets, a 24/7 servant, freedom from his overbearing parents, and that souped up car. Some guys get all the luck.</pre>

This chart isn&#39;t showing that the percentage of young voters who support Bernie is 20 points higher than the percentage of young voters who support the next candidate.</pre>

<pre>@WaywardWinifred @MorningConsult There also appears to be some 77/33 mistake. I&#39;ll assume for now the 33 is accurate and the 77 meant to be a 67.</pre>
