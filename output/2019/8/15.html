Text: @MeetThePress @agearan As Bernie Sanders surely knew before he said this, Bezos uses exclusively the right, artistic hemisphere of his brain to steward the Washington Post, while reserving the left, analytical hemisphere of his brain for founding and owning Amazon.

Text: When Birthright first began its program of complimentary trips for Jews worldwide, interest was tepid; hesitant, even. Enthusiasm picked up as the program switched to free airfare, rather than its initial model of chartering trains.

Text: @enr0n_hubbard My worry is, who's to say anyone knows how to fix this? I'm not sure how strong of a track record anyone has for fixing this thing in others.

And yet, it is surely fixable. It wasn't always like this. I'll Whisman my way out of it someday, to use the local seeming success story.

Text: They say fair skin originally became considered attractive as a mark of being well-off, not having to toil all day outdoors. It is out of dedication to this same aesthetic and sexual ideal that I scrupulously avoid ever exercising.
