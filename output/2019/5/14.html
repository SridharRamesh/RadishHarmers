Text: As a demisexual, I can only enjoy sex when truly in love. I have only half my genitalia (not the optimists' half, yet wilder than the pessimists dream. Topologically and logistically burdensome; ¬º here, ¬º there‚Ä¶). You'd have to truly love me to have sex under the circumstances.

Text: @dunkrug @Heidi__Matthews @nobody_stop_me @annakhachiyan Given the amount of self-retweeting I do, I'm sort of a showboat, in some ways, but I agree with everything else!
