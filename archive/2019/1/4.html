<pre>I&#39;d just like to drop the also true reminder that Donald Trump ALSO received more votes for president than any other man who&#39;s run without being Obama. Truly a great leader.

<pre>Everything about Spotify is frustrating other than the wide selection of music to stream. All modern software is designed painfully opposite to my preferences.</pre>

<pre>Brooklyn plumber Mario&#39;s name is pronounced the way Mario Cuomo did it: rhyming with Barry O. I will never abandon this.

Also, Luigi&#39;s name is properly pronounced to rhyme with his brother, Iggy Koopa. No medium has yet portrayed this correctly. It is Nintendo&#39;s shameful secret.</pre>

<pre>Your dad grew up in the 1950s/60s, trained to hide all unmanly emotion. Yet he lets himself be intimately silly for you. You ingrate, sneering at &quot;dad jokes&quot;. He&#39;s trying his best. Is this what he went to Vietnam for?</pre>
