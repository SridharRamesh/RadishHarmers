Text: @marx_is_pog I'm aware. I don't find that a compelling argument in a world where a great many actions individuals take have a much larger individual environmental impact than making an NFT. The existence of the Internet requires gobs of computer power but making a tweet isn't immoral.

Text: @TobyHusseinKeit @marx_is_pog If the impact of making an NFT is less than the impact of driving across the country, it feels extremely weird to call someone highly immoral for doing the former once or twice, when no one gets called highly immoral for doing the latter once or twice.
