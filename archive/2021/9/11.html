<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I hate that when I put a link at the end of a message in a DM, Twitter moves it to showing before the message. That&#39;s not where I said for it to go. I wrote the link at the position where I wanted it to show up.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sure, more people are familiar with C-style syntax now, but up until very recently, thousands of times more people were familiar with the math symbols, which are just Greek letters. Σ is a Greek S, for &quot;Sum&quot;. Π is a Greek P, for &quot;Product&quot;. Just different keywords.</p></blockquote>

People aren&#39;t born knowing what a &quot;for loop&quot; is; that&#39;s from Algol in 1958. Nor &quot;++&quot;, etc. The C syntax here was popularized in 1972 (invented around 1969 for obscure language B). The math symbols were around for centuries before that. https://t.co/iKfluMtrFZ</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@marx_knopfler More regular in what way? The distinction here also has nothing to do with subscripts or superscripts. One bother with the for loop syntax here is that for loops in general are construed as allowing side effects, mutation, etc, which is rather more to worry about, not less.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@marx_knopfler I&#39;m not against programming, of course. I think of many things in such terms. In this particular case, the imperative for loop has added unnecessary details, like a specific computation order (left-associated evaluation, so to speak). That is a bothersome lack of abstraction.</p></blockquote>
