Text: I'm cheating with this tweet. This was taken from a sketch I did at San Francisco Sketchfest 2017. I know no one ever wants to read a sketch, particularly not one where half the fun was the audio, but if that's the sort of thing you would enjoy, go ahead and enjoy it. https://t.co/6LS4yKrjZC

Text: I have a recording of the sketch somewhere, but non-professional recordings of live sketches are always too low quality to watch. Also, for whatever reason, the FX channel did a recording of one of the performances too, but I have no idea what ever became of that footage.

Text: On this reversal, that gibberish turned out to say "That's the end of our show. Thanks for watching. Hail Satan, hail Satan!". I had trained the actor meticulously to speak this backwards for the filming. (Not a joke, for real)

One of my favorite cross-sketch ideas we ever did.

Text: This continued into playing through a bit of the previous sketch in reverse. The previous sketch was a filmed sketch. At one point in that previous sketch, a crazy character had spoken in seeming gibberish.

Text: Us live actors reversed all our movements throughout the sketch, while all the audio was played in reverse as well (however, substituted such that each Satanic hymn was treated as reversing into a song and vice versa).

Text: All but one of us in the group thought that would be very fun and funny, but alas, one person objected foot-downedly to the idea that it would momentarily look like a genuine screw-up. The usual conflicts of collaboration. But I aspire to still re-stage this and do that someday.

Text: It would look like a genuine mistake.

But during the reverse at the end, at the appropriate moment, the hat would suddenly come flying back onto their head. The audience would realize that "mistake" had been intentional.

Text: Another joke was to be that at the start of Satanic Records, when setting the stage, an actor would screw up in a small but noticeable way. Come out still wearing a hat from a previous sketch, realize in a panic, and throw it backstage before lights come up.

Text: I know this isn't truly an Amazon worker speaking her mind, but Christ, how utterly beaten down, how diseased, to suppose an employer deserves to control who you may fraternize with via what channels in your human being life. Company-approved friends on company-approved outings. https://t.co/aeUMK41vVS

Text: @AliceFromQueens I basically agree with everything you've said about Woody Allen. He famously does not care about putting work into film as a visual medium, and it's also the case that his films mostly stopped being good at about the same time as the scandal. I just remember your dad liking him.

Text: @AliceFromQueens Which is to say, film is a medium that allows for being used to its full potential with visual care, but you can still make other kinds of films that are enjoyable all the same. For a while there, Woody Allen was pulling that off. For a while, the other elements were good enough.
