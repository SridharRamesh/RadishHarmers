Text: All these arbitrary things happened to me; rolls of a die one way vs. another, and I've had to carve out a self from them. It could just as well have been different, different experiences, different interests, hangups and obsessions, but now I cling to this identity like it's me.

Text: RT @RadishHarmers: I mean, they're fictional characters. They don't have grand principles. They'd have voted for whoever the writers though…

Text: It's funny to see all the rich celebs enthralledly RTing some minor workplace flap (one coworker accidentally discarding another's lunch), as though they too work the kind of mind-numbingly tedious jobs where you pretend that stuff is intriguing high drama to get through the day.
