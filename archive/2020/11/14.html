<pre>One has to do with exponentiation. PEMDAS/BODMAS makes it look like exponentiation takes precedence over everything else. This is wrong. The notational convention is not for 2³ ⁺ ⁴ to be interpreted as 2³ added to 4.</pre>

<pre>There are two other useful facts it could convey but it gets them both wrong.</pre>

<pre>The actual notational convention for exponentiation is that the base of exponentiation is the shortest expression possible (in 1 + 2³, the base of the cubing is taken as 2, not 1 + 2). The power doesn&#39;t need any such convention to parse. It&#39;s explicitly delimited as superscript.</pre>

<p>
<pre>This shortest base convention also clarifies how to read iterated exponentiation. PEMDAS/BODMAS doesn&#39;t offer any clarity on this. But in an expression like below, the base of the squaring is taken to be 3, not 4³, so the whole expression is read as 4 raised to the ninth power. https://t.co/54zgp9yqiq</pre>

<p>
<pre>The other fact PEMDAS/BODMAS tries to convey has to do with strings of +s and -s. PEMDAS/BODMAS makes it look like addition takes precedence over subtraction.

But everyone soon learns &quot;Actually, ignore the mnemonic, you should do addition and subtraction together left-to-right&quot;.</pre>

<p>
<pre>The convention with a string of -s and +s is that these are punctuation separating all the values to combine. Values directly after a - are subtracted or negated, the rest are added. You can use whatever order you want, just keep track of what&#39;s subtracted/negated and what isn&#39;t.</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>The bother is just, in a string like -3 + 4 - 5 + 6, how far does the scope of the negation or the &quot;thing being subtracted&quot; go after each - symbol? Does this mean to take 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 and negate it? Does this mean to take -3 + 4 and subtract 5 + 6 from it?</pre>

<p>
<pre>Even this isn&#39;t quite right, though. It&#39;s not that addition and subtraction must be done left-to-right. If you look at 3 + 4 + 5 and decide to add 4 to 5 first, and then add 3 to that, you&#39;re doing something perfectly fine.</pre>

<pre>Where there would be ambiguity otherwise:

1. Multiplication takes precedence over addition/subtraction (My ASs)

2. The base of exponentiation is the shortest thing possible.

3. +s and -s are separators, and you subtract what has a - in front of it.</pre>

<pre>In -3 + 4 - 5 + 6, the 3 and the 5 are subtracted, and the 4 and the 6 are added. You can combine these four values in whatever order you want. 4 minus 3, then subtract 5 from that, then add 6 onto that. Or 6 minus 5, add 4 to that, subtract 3 from that. Whatever you like.</pre>

<pre>Division certainly doesn&#39;t &quot;come before&quot; addition, as PEMDAS/BODMAS would tell you. This doesn&#39;t mean &quot;Divide 1 by 2, and add that to 3&quot; or &quot;Divide 1 by 3 and add 2 to that&quot;. But you&#39;d never think that anyway. https://t.co/MKriUxVIEA</pre>

<pre>If someone writes 1/2π, they&#39;re more likely to mean &quot;The reciprocal of 2π&quot; than to mean &quot;Half of π&quot;, but you&#39;d really just better ask them to clarify.</pre>

<pre>And something like 1÷2π? Here&#39;s the deal. No one uses ÷ outside of elementary school. It&#39;s like writing &quot;Congreſs&quot;. It&#39;s archaic. If you see a ÷, you&#39;re talking to someone who never actually reads or writes math. Again, all bets are off on what they mean. You&#39;ll have to ask them.</pre>

<pre>It&#39;s genuinely ambiguous, just like &quot;Bob doesn&#39;t like John because he&#39;s rude&quot; is ambiguous as to whether it&#39;s Bob who is rude or John who is rude. Math isn&#39;t different from anything else you can say with words. It&#39;s possible to say things that aren&#39;t clear and need clarification.</pre>

<pre>Similarly, you&#39;d never read 24 as meaning 2 times 4 instead of twenty-four. There&#39;s a million conventions you&#39;ve internalized without anyone formalizing them for you like a dumb machine.</pre>

<pre>No, no one needs to tell you this, because there&#39;s no other way you could have read it. There&#39;s no such thing as adding 3 - (4 on the one hand to 5) on the other hand. 3 - (4 isn&#39;t a thing and 5) isn&#39;t a thing. You&#39;d never have read it this way anyway.</pre>

<pre>All of this is only notational convention and has nothing to do with actual mathematical content. And the only reason it&#39;s needed is because we&#39;ve picked stupid notation that doesn&#39;t make it clear where things began and end. We could&#39;ve picked better notation but didn&#39;t.

My ASs, shortest base, and subtract what has a minus sign in front. Just know those three.</pre>
