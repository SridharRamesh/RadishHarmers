Text: FWIW, there are also propositions of which I would be willing to make friendly wagers either way, at any of a spectrum of prices, in idle gambling fun. And I'd still be Dutch book resistant, for having made one bet, I then restrict which others I am willing to make atop it.

Text: @christianpbrink @BlueyMcPhluey It did well, we won Best Writing and 2nd Best Film, but the nature of the 48 Hour Film Project means very low bars to clear to achieve that, and a hundred little suboptimalities and shooting day problems we'd have fixed had there only been more time.
