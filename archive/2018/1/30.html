<pre>My phone&#39;s display is really badly fucked up, almost completely unusable. Bizarre colors and patterns of lines, shifting every few days. I&#39;d take a photo to show you, but it&#39;s the one thing it&#39;s rather difficult to photograph.</pre>

<pre>Having to get a new phone is making a Buridan&#39;s ass out of me. Let&#39;s go back to the old days when you just leased whatever Ma Bell deigned to give you.</pre>

<pre>@liftrss I found out today that my boss is 25. I&#39;m firmly into my 30s. I&#39;m fretting to get my health insurance set up through the company, and my boss is still on his parents&#39;.</pre>

<pre>@liftrss Yeah; apart from the above, for me, this news is extremely neutral. It is about what I expected. (I just wanted to join in on the bad news fun…)</pre>

<pre>Boys DM: Ah, that @radishharmers is such a clever and impressive fellow. I look forward each day to his tweets.

Girls DM: A worthy choice for all to follow. This site would be immeasurably poorer without ol&#39; Sridhar.</pre>

<pre>@Styl_oh Seriously, though I hate trying to convey pronunciations through &quot;phonetic spelling&quot; (the most ambiguity-laden thing) instead of IPA, /ʃrɪdar/ would be like &quot;Shrid-are&quot;, and /ʃrid̪ʰɚ/ would be like (though not exactly) &quot;Shree-ther&quot; (with a &quot;th&quot; like in &quot;the&quot;, not like in &quot;thin&quot;).</pre>
