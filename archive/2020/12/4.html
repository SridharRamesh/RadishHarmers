<pre>@georgiamarxist @SamuelGWalters Well, sure, but lots of infinitely differentiable functions don&#39;t match the power series constructed in this way. Bump functions and such. Of course, this is informal, not meant to be rigorous as such, but bringing the word analytic into it seemed a little weird.</pre>

<pre>@georgiamarxist @SamuelGWalters This is clever, I like it, but the gloss of what it shows is a bit weird, since I am accustomed to &quot;analytic&quot; being defined so it is nearly (not entirely, because of a local/global distinction, but nearly so) a plain tautology that an analytic function matches its power series.</pre>

What it shows it this: Suppose you have a function, and you define from it not just one Taylor series centered at one point, but all the Taylor series centered at each possible center. You can consider two converse things now:</pre>

<pre>@georgiamarxist @SamuelGWalters Let T(x, a) be the evaluation x of the Taylor series for f centered at a. A naive term-wise differentiability calculation for d/da T(x, a) naively telescopes to 0. This tells us T(x, a) = T(x, x) = f(x). That&#39;s what this demonstrates.

What can go wrong?</pre>

So I&#39;m curious to figure out exactly what we&#39;ve demonstrated leads to what.</pre>

<pre>@georgiamarxist @SamuelGWalters What do you mean it falls apart? That&#39;s exactly what&#39;s being demonstrated, that T(x, a) should not depend on a at all. We want the sum of f^({n)}(a) (x - a)^n/n! to be f(x), which shouldn&#39;t depend on a at all. This is the point in the OP of finding the derivative to be zero.</pre>
