<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My TO DO list is one of those gotcha assignments that starts with &quot;Read all instructions carefully before starting&quot; and then towards the end says &quot;By the way, don&#39;t do any of these. If you do, you fail. Don&#39;t believe the other instructions&#39; lies. I&#39;m the one to trust&quot;.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@RadioSqrl @MADdelaRosa @isaiah_kb People shouldn&#39;t have to move to have lives with dignity, and lives need to be improved all over, to where there isn&#39;t significant global inequity. Nonetheless, if anyone wants to move, it&#39;s immoral to stop them. Borders are the cause of so much horror in the world.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@RadioSqrl @MADdelaRosa @isaiah_kb If landlords demanded the right birth standing and prestige to live in their building, you would surely find this archetypally unacceptable, from your political principles. The system of borders, citizenship, immigration restrictions, etc, is much the same, on a grander scale.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@RadioSqrl @MADdelaRosa @isaiah_kb Or perhaps the gated community is indeed the paradise sought under the leftist banner? (Like all analogies, these do not capture everything perfectly, but I think they capture some salient aspects.)</p></blockquote>
