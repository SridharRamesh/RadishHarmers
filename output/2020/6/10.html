Text: I'm being a bit charitable calling this a conversation. Here's the entirety of it (second and third images in reverse chronological order). He says "We all agree Black Lives Matter, let's not infight", she chides him, then she demands payment. 30K people agree. Twitter is wild. https://t.co/WwuLCN3gWJ

Text: @DEEPTHROAT_ACAB Yeah, I realize now, his first post that she replied to wasn't even specifically about Black Lives Matter, just a very abstract thing about infighting.

Text: All I did on Twitter today was get irked at other Twitter-poisoned dummies for being dumb in Twitter-poisoned ways. That's not a good way to use this site. Better to light a candle.

Text: Our requirements make longitudes vertical and latitudes horizontal. Since latitudes further from the Equator are shorter but have to be drawn with the same width (to keep longitudes drawn vertically), we must draw horizontal distance more stretched out further from the Equator.

Text: (There's some subtlety about interpreting this at the poles. To let vertical longitudes cross at the poles, we should actually think of the Mercator map as on the sides of a cylinder, with the poles comprising top and bottom disks of the cylinder. But nevermind this subtlety.)

Text: Between all the RTs, this got millions of Likes, but I don't think it's true Mercator sought to inflate the area of Christendom. It's just the unique map where North is always straight up and angles in the vicinity of any point are accurately represented (useful for navigation). https://t.co/Op46hZAwrj

Text: A side effect of this construction will be one of my favorite observations, computing the surface area of a sphere (as its diameter times its circumference)!

Text: There's much more to say about flat maps of spheres and distances and angles. Beautiful stuff, a whole beautiful theory. But the video here was about representing areas accurately, so I'll discuss that for now. I'll show how you can make a map that represents areas accurately.

Text: So Mercator keeps longitudes vertical, latitudes horizontal, and angles near any point accurate, but distorts distances and areas. The distance scale is the same in all directions at any point, but changes between latitudes precisely so as to make all latitudes the same width.

Text: People usually cut off the Mercator map after some latitudes, to keep it finite.

Another subtlety is that the Earth isn't a perfect sphere, but nevermind that either. Twitter isn't the place for subtleties, and I really want to discuss spheres rather than the Earth anyway.)

Text: (It turns out the total vertical stretching is so bad, our cylinder actually grows infinitely tall, basically to accommodate the matching infinite horizontal stretching required to make tiny circles of latitude around the poles as wide as the Equator. But nevermind this subtlety.

Text: To keep angles accurate, we have to also stretch out vertical distance by the same factor near any point. And therefore area near that point gets stretched out by the square of that factor. The further from the Equator, the more the stretching.
