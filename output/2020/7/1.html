Text: @ligneousTyler @HelpfulKraken I see both @HelpfulKraken and I converged on the same idea framed similarly, playing out logically from the quoted tweet. I had not seen @HelpfulKraken's tweet until now (I get no validation jollies by stealing), but I acknowledge it was prior to mine. https://t.co/GjtKWHe8KI

Text: @nobagdad @darth_erogenous If strapping someone to a board, gagging their mouth and nose, and pouring water on them doesn't count as touching someone, then firing a bullet into someone's face might as well not count as touching them.

Text: @haircut_hippie I think I'm over that now. I'm in a generally decent overall mood these days. I'm in some shallower rut now. Maybe I'm just out of practice doing things.

Text: @jeb_bush_2020 @shreyabasu003 @rens_twi A domicile is too big for you to hope to not have any mosquitoes already in there somewhere, or be able to effectively purge the whole place if one gets in. A bed is the right size that you can establish it as mosquito free when you put up the net and thus keep it that way.

Text: @CarlisiSteve @doormatmccarthy @darth_erogenous I'd certainly like to believe that's what Colin was doing, being sarcastic. It's possible, I don't know, I'll have to investigate the context more.

Text: @CarlisiSteve @doormatmccarthy @darth_erogenous Hm, I really don't think he's being sarcastic. I think it's just that 2004 era War on Terror mindset everyone deferred to at the time. https://t.co/8JtKzKiJwm

Text: People get more conservative as they age. I've observed extensive evidence of this pattern in studying the casual prejudices of beloved characters created decades ago, alongside the windows into their woker youth available from recently made prequels.

Text: Do people still say "woke"? I think maybe not, but there must be some word people still use for a similar meaning. It is important I learn these things. We must continually be learning.

Text: When I was 25, the world was full of boundless potential. A fresh canvas where anything could happen.

At 35, it's exactly the same.
