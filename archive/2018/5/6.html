<pre>@crulge Of course we shouldn&#39;t center the already well-off, as such, but this particular worry is odd. Who thinks the proposal is &quot;We should all travel to Europe on our own dime and then use their healthcare&quot;? The idea is clearly &quot;We should do here what&#39;s been proven to work elsewhere&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@crulge It seems to me a little overly paranoid to worry the disadvantaged will resent the &quot;I saw with my own eyes the difference&quot; messenger here, unable to recognize the argument being, uh, &quot;messenged&quot;.

(But, eh, there can be framing issues I guess, so, alright; I&#39;ll leave it at that.)</pre>

<pre>Old men in the 80s mocking kids saying &quot;bad&quot; complimentarily:

Hey, you dumb kids! That word doesn&#39;t mean quite what you think…
[snickers]
Look up the word &#39;good&#39;! (That&#39;s G-O-O-D). I think you&#39;ll find it quite eye-opening…

<pre>@brocialistmeme @brocialistmeme Huh, did you delete all your old tweets when you went on hiatus, @brocialistmeme? I remember being happy with our conversation here, but I guess it is now lost to the sands of time.</pre>
