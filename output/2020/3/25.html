Text: @asmeurer No it doesn't, not in the sense I'm talking about. Same problem. An exponential function is one whose logarithm has a constant derivative. The logistic function's logarithm has an always decreasing derivative, and the same is true of the logistic function's derivative.

Text: @asmeurer I.e., given equally spaced inputs A &lt; B &lt; C, the ratio f(C)/f(B) will always be smaller than the ratio f(B)/f(A), when f is the logistic function or its derivative. With logistic distribution of new cases over time, both the cumulative and new cases grow subexponentially.

Text: @asmeurer Not "Same time to go from 100 to 1,000 as from 1,000 to 10,000"; the latter always takes longer.

Text: @reezels Logic. More specifically, category-theoretic logic. More specifically, my dissertation research was on a category-theoretic framing and generalization of the phenomena around Gödel's incompleteness theorem and the Gödel-Löb modal logic of provability.

Text: @reezels My advisor suggested titling my thesis "Abstract Provability Structures", which is vague, but is also a fine 10,000 feet description. Research on some mathematical structures abstractly describing the notion of provability, and particularly proofs about proofs about proofs, etc.

Text: Like Londoners during the Blitz, I hope I discover in the confines of my house a portal to a faraway land of my wildest fantasy, where I succumb to temptation with delight by a chilly white woman, thereby causing Jesus to be killed. Years later, I realize the delight was so-so.

Text: It finally happened. First the 39 year old who died, then the 36 year old New Yorker who died, now a 34 year old New Yorker in serious condition due to coronavirus. That's the threshold for me. That's where my fear discretely rockets up. Was she over or under 34 and 9 months?

Text: Folks eat up that rollercoaster and bungee cord shit, but as a rule, I don't enjoy any activity whose alleged thrill is your body yelling the whole time "WHOA THIS ISN'T WHAT I WAS MADE FOR OH NO". I tend to be on the same page as my body. I feel a certain kinship with my body.

Text: I hate quarantine but what I hate about it only reflects my privilege, like hating that I can't just pop out to buy things on demand as I am accustomed to, like food and toiletries and… Wait, maybe this isn't so grossly privileged… Online dynamics have me overly self-conscious.
