Text: "I'm lying right now", jokes Pinocchio with sly grin. His nose grows and shrinks erratically, rapidly. Where its wood rubs against his face, sparks form; soon his whole frame is ablaze. "Oh God! I should never have toyed with the forces of propositional logic!". His nose shrinks.

Text: Major Internet services should be public utilities, and shouldn't get to ban anyone, any more than we expect the same of telephone or mail service. Like everything in a decent society, they should be universal programs. Convicted violent felons should have access to them.

Text: If crimes are so dangerous they demand being cut-off to the utilities of modern society, then apply criminal trial. Buy an island and banish the convicts there. But I don't want a world of 100 little ad hoc No Fly lists, lacking transparency, due process, or democratic mandate.

Text: In the rest of the world, the traditional color of the Libertarian party is green, while the traditional color of the Green party is gold. Only in the stupid U.S. are these reversed (even here, they used to swap every four years, but solidified after the prolonged 2000 election).
