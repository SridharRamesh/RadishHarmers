<pre>@ConnorSouthard When I went to watch it in theaters, there was a young girl in the audience, whose mother ended up forcing her to leave in the middle of the movie against her protests. I don&#39;t know what to make of this. I remember this more sharply then the movie, though I believe I enjoyed it.</pre>

<pre>@ConnorSouthard I imagine the girl and her mother thought going into it that it was a straight movie about chess, nothing weird, but that the girl was intrigued and onboard as it turned out not to be, while the mother was upset at the mentions of sex or the like.</pre>
