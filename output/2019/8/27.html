Text: (I recognize the irony of broadcasting this to thousands of strangers in the same space where I post jokes, but social media is a weird personal-public hybrid space. Also, do not mistake me as deluded as to whether my opinions matter; my delusions lie elsewhere.)

Text: Someone called a comedian a philosopher once, and it was such an appealing image, it ruined the genre. I really have no interest in truths in lieu of jokes, even when the truths are true.

Text: I often agree when comedians complain about the current state of comedy and of audience expectations, but I don't think the complaint in itself makes for interesting comedy either. Grumble offstage.

Text: @MarginalScribbl I would say it's perfectly possible to understand the nuances of prob/stats without a super strong grounding in trigonometry, unless you're really worried about convergence issues in proving the Central Limit Theorem using moment-generating rather than characteristic functions.

Text: @MarginalScribbl I'm certainly not anti-trig, it helps understand things, everything ties together at some level, but just as well, there's no fixed linear order in which to learn things. There's a web you can explore in all kinds of orders, over all kinds of subsets.

Text: @MarginalScribbl People should learn whatever they want, whenever they want; if they want to study trigonometry, great, and if not, also fine by me. In terms of some hypothetical "Citizen's Statistics" type class, I don't know that trigonometry is really doing much.

Text: @MarginalScribbl Roundabout in what way? Roundabout suggests a particular goal you are coming at backwards. But if your goal is understanding continuous probability distributions, then tossing in all this other stuff that has nothing to do with them is roundabout. Everything is goal-dependent.

Text: @MarginalScribbl Certainly, if someone already has fluency with trig, build on that. If not, use some other examples. As I said, what's the value of the Law of Sines to anything here?

(But also, why am I arguing? It doesn't really matter. It's all fine.)

Text: @MarginalScribbl Right. I agree. People who use prob/stats should understand it instead of blindly following cookbooks (where we see so much difficulty arising with misunderstanding p-values, etc). And understanding continuous probability distributions requires understanding relevant calculus.

Text: @MarginalScribbl Understanding that this whole structure is the same as the structure of high-dimensional Euclidean geometry is great.

But lots of people could accurately be claimed to understand prob/stats at a reasonable level without ever thinking of this, so, it's no prerequisite, really.
