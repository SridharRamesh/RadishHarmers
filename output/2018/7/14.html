Text: I liked but didn't love Sorry to Bother You. Its politics were in the right place, but as a film, it was all over the place.

Text: @matthewaraven This depends on what you're looking for in a movie-watching experience, and how much you value money. I can say I don't regret my purchase.

Text: All the people with very specific political ideologies based on very specific dead Communists would hate me if they knew my point of view was cobbled together from Garfield comics, the first half of Office Space, and imagining the essay "The Right to be Lazy" might be describing.

Text: Many of these posts are first drafts. 

They are then highly edited and revised, so much shaping and re-shaping goes into them before posting, but they are first drafts.

Text: This is only about #300 on the poor design of this site, of course, and that is all behind the thousands of outright bugs. I'd set my time machine in rectifying pursuit of infant @jack; the road less travelled.

Text: It should be possible to retweet tweets with also a choice of provided context of what they are in reply to, instead of roundabout screenshot nonsense (screwing up who the replies and other engagement go to, unsearchable by text, etc).

Text: Corruption in gymnastics judging runs deep in its standards. If you pull off a run of incredible athletic acrobatic flips and twirls, I don't care if you "stick" the landing. You've earnt a right to sit down at the end. It's the convoluted journey, not the contrived destination.
