Text: I'm up to double-digit follower-losses in one day.

(On the rare occasions I've pulled off the opposite, I've felt like a God. This is all a burden for me to be aware of. Get me to the point where I can't see the least significant digits anymore.)

Text: I’d get the fixation on π's digits if anyone had stuff to say about them, anything. But there’s only one thing to say (“They can't just cycle”), and that thing's better put in non-digit terms (“π's not x/y for whole x, y”), so the empty pop obsession with those digits frustrates.

Text: Children are correct to be bored by recitations of memorized digits of π, and the like; to find it an uncompelling advertisement for mathematics. And those children who are into that stuff? They are incorrect.

Text: (All my math tweets end up being about numbers and arithmetic, for natural but unfortunate reasons, perpetuating a rather narrow image of what math is. I wonder what the pithiest generally comprehensible thing about my actual field of logic that I could put in a tweet would be.)

Text: Legacy is hard. Most die forgotten. But a few manage to pull it off, succeeding in having their names remembered for all time. Rare examples such as Charlemagne. Genghis Khan. Ozymandias.

Text: "Which one do I shoot? WHICH ONE DO I SHOOT?!", I ask in panic, gun in trembling hand going back and forth, as I am confronted by the malevolently cackling stranger looking just like me. Oh! Ask a question only I'd know the answer to! Ah, I'll let him finish his monologue first…

Text: He names the town where I attended high school with ease (I quickly confirm the answer against my Facebook profile, and several classmates' to be sure). Thank god that's settled; the adrenaline is still pumping, but the decision is now clear.

Text: @jaubert_moniker @cutasterfee @ErinGoudreau I think you did a fine job! You've now inspired me to try to to come up with a math tweet for my limited math audience that plays on both "taxicab numbers" and "taxicab geometry".
