Text: If you're going to survive into 2021, you should go get coronavirus this year. If you wait till you're older, the results could be lethal.

Text: @gpork @GarbageApe I don't actually think Leibniz should be considered wrong about infinitesimals, as such. Indeed, I think epsilontics have been a net negative for calculus pedagogy, and where pedantic formality is sought, we have both Robinson- and Lawvere-style infinitesimal analysis available.

Text: @gpork @GarbageApe However, I still felt the image of Voltaire and Berkeley tag-teaming on poor bloodied Leibniz was amusing. Turn him to biscuits, boys.

Text: @gpork @GarbageApe I even think, on the phrase Leibniz endorses which Voltaire savaged, one could provide some defense, purely as to the metaphysics of alethic modality. But all the same, Voltaire was correct in his savaging. Thus end my sincere comments on Leibniz. https://t.co/6hugeUcj5U

Text: @gpork @GarbageApe Oh! This is then somewhat matched by my second point about Leibniz (we could define "best of all possible worlds" in this way, but why would we?).

Text: @gpork @GarbageApe But also, everyone always talks about Lagrangian/Hamiltonian formulations of physics as though we solve for optima, when all they actually demand are vanishing derivative (stationary action, not least action); optimum, anti-optimum, saddle, whatever.

Text: I'm not too old to have kids, but I'm too old to fix my flaws, meet someone, fall in love, build a life together, and then have kids. Plus corona delay. By the time I'm a proper adult, the ship will have sailed so far one could prove the Earth round from its dip into the horizon.

Text: Since it's the topic du jour (as no one here understands randos saying rando dumb things doesn't matter) and since I've just turned 35, sincerely, I want to have kids. Much more than any of the things I actually am made to spend my life doing. But I fret constantly it's too late.

Text: @S_Ordibehesht @johncarlosbaez @JadeMasterMath @brachyrhynchos @narchymed Presumably, the intended interpretation to take, if we're to interpret these series as having particular numerical values in themselves, is where a = ζ(1/2) - ζ(1/2)/sqrt(2) and b = ζ(1/2)/sqrt(2).

Text: Fuck. I'd finally set up the domino chain, thousands upon thousands of dominos in a dizzying array of meticulously planned delights. I started it going, but about twenty dominos in, the batteries died. They're stuck standing. Now I have to go one by one recharging each one.
