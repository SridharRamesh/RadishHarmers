Text: @MattWatchGundam @quasicoherence I'm sorry, but it's true. Chalk dust is terrible and mathematicians overly fetishize it. Get a good whiteboard for your office that you're in control of, make sure no one damages it with the wrong cleaning products or markers, and you'll live a happier, longer life.
