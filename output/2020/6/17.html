Text: @ComradeLuanne I've been saying this forever, to no avail. I've been saying it since I was a kid. Anyone who knows what multiplication means can repeatedly add to work such tables out for themselves, if they ever need to. Why force fast rote recall drills? Pointless ritual, like much of school.

Text: @antifasenpai @ComradeLuanne It's marginally useful to have 7 times 17 memorized too. Or to know how to play tuba and piano. But it's not reasonable to try to force children to acquire every possibly marginally useful skill ahead of time, against their own lack of interest. It'd be both impossible and cruel.

Text: @ParSpec @ComradeLuanne Great, that's a perfectly fine way to understand it. The point being, it doesn't matter to anyone at all that they have not memorized multiplication tables out to such length. And in the same way, it is not important to memorize multiplication tables out to any length either.

Text: @mardirooster @ComradeLuanne You don't have to remember 7 times 7 either, because you can reduce it to additions. Yet in this case, you feel it is important not to do the reduction and to have the answer memorized, whereas you are happy having 7 times 17 not memorized and reducing it to other calculations.

Text: @mardirooster @ComradeLuanne Exponentiation or square root tables would save far more time than multiplication tables save! After all, it's rather more of a chore to compute the square root of 7 from scratch than to compute 7 times 7. But, rightly, no one tells you to bother memorizing these, all the same.

Text: @mardirooster @ComradeLuanne Why? It's all just inertia. People used to teach times tables, so they still teach times tables. They think it's important because someone made them do it. I'll even grant it had some use, before the electronic calculator existed. Now we all have one in our pocket all the time.

Text: @logophobe @mardirooster @ComradeLuanne There's no point memorizing calculations. Being able to understand them is another thing. Memorizing 7 x 7 has no mathematical content. Knowing what 7 x 7 means and being able to compute its value from scratch, at whatever comfortable pace, well, that has content.

It can save you time to have some stuff memorized. It saves you even more time to use a calculator. As I noted, if asked to determine the square root of 2 * 7, what do you do?

Anything you can do with times tables memorized, you can do without them memorized, just slower by working out what was memorized in the table. But if speed was truly the goal, you'd allow yourself to use a calculator.
