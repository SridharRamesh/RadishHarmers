Text: Things are getting scary out there with coronavirus. Who knows what tomorrow holds? We really shouldn't be alone right now. A good time to get physically intimate with strangers whose online posts you enjoy, imo.

Text: @IHateNYT Hm, it appears Dale is the one who dresses fit for Florida. Next time, I will think more carefully before cracking wise, as to whether I am making the best use of the situation.

Text: Who among us can forget how LBJ swept to victory on the coveted Vaughn Meader endorsement, confirming his presumption as handpicked successor? Nixon, on the other hand, never forgave Eisenhower for declining to be popularly impersonated. https://t.co/SRbZ6ffEXZ

Text: @athenogenes What am I going to point to from tonight? Seems like maybe I'll remember 2020 in a general sense, or the first reports of coronavirus, or something. Something happened with stocks today? I don't know, seems not the first mover in the chain.

Text: @athenogenes I knew I didn't know anything about anything, but I still don't know. Certainly, you could be right; that is part of my not knowing. We'll see. But I'd rather the decisive disaster were coronavirus. I don't have any oil shock jokes.

Text: The last Democrat to get anything done (a mix of awful and good things, yes) was LBJ. Famously nice, plays well with others, gentle and genteel LBJ. That's how the game is shrewdly won. FDR put the New Deal in place through charm offensive and compromise. Speak softly, full stop.
