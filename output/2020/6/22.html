Text: @reezels By coincidence, I watched it last night too. Abandoned it in the middle, then finished it today. Really bad. Clunky and just plain boring. The critics praising it are insane, like they've never seen a film before and are impressed by mere moving image.

Text: @EdelweissBlood @reezels You are correct that the Lahu do not show up again. It is a chore even to remember this, the plot is so unmemorable. There is one surprising moment in the entire movie, a sort of jump scare. That's it. (Actually, it happens twice, but even the movie doesn't care the second time.)

Text: @EdelweissBlood @reezels Some critics say nevermind the plot, it's about the relationships and blah blah. Wrong too. There's only one character who gets to do anything, and nothing about his relationships rises beyond disjointed bits and pieces of cliches you've seen before. Same for the movie overall.

Text: @Dxnnyszn @len0killer Congratulations to Thomas. This has got to be the greatest post of all time, given how it manages to still do these numbers afresh each time someone steals it.

Text: Of course firefighters would be setting off the fireworks. Those things are fire hazards. Firefighters encountering them on nightly patrol would naturally launch them as far away into the sky as possible.

Text: My past, each decision, each regret, stretched out behind me as a tail. Monstrous, cumbersome, knocking over chairs. Like salamanders', if ever cut off, another grows to replace it.

Text: I missed my shot to be molded into a superhero and wealthy playboy via the catalyzing influence of witnessing the murder of my parents in front of me. Another dream dead. I can only hope to experience it vicariously, through my children.

Text: Coronavirus came, washed over the whole country as everyone was eager to imitate the new trend, then went away. Then the protests came, washed over the whole country by imitation, and went away. Now fireworks are the hip nationwide trend. No need for elaborate conspiracy theory.

Text: I am 35, for the record. This would be one of my favorite ages to be, if I had already hit the appropriate milestones and initial achievements. I have not, but in my defense, coronavirus was in play the last four months.

Text: I would give everything I own to be a himbo, a simple-headed hunk. To be able to say just one thing straight, without having to wrap it in layers of cleverness and irony. No I wouldn't. No, this is false. Fuck fuck fuck.
