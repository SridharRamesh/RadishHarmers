Text: We don't need both "physician, heal thyself" and "taste your own medicine". Either one was sufficient; two is poor form. No need to lecture busybody doctors so much. Follow the advice you prescribe.

This will all be addressed once they add tweet editing, of course.

Text: @DrNO_NC @bridgietherease Because they're where all modern distribution takes place. If they don't host it, it essentially doesn't exist. If the argument is that they get to do what they want because they're private, well, they are de facto monopolies and, in my opinion, ought as well be nationalized.

Text: @DrNO_NC @bridgietherease If each particular major distribution channel is a private corporation that gets to do what it wants, and each particular major distribution channel one by one blocks you, it's no consolation to say "Well, there's not just ONE. Hardly a monopoly, with so many alternatives.".

Text: @DrNO_NC @bridgietherease Try hosting long videos on Twitter after YouTube blocks you; see how convenient that is. Of course being blocked by YouTube is a big impediment to distribution; otherwise, no one would care to have YouTube block people.

Text: @bridgietherease @DrNO_NC Incitements to "terror" are already crimes, to be pursued as criminal justice matters (love too have FB, Twitter, Spotify…, be arbiters of criminal justice, and especially convenient this is seen as devoid of free speech concerns by virtue of them being non-government entities).

Text: @chick_in_kiev In some ways, I'm immediately unhappy with my gnomic tweet's wording, but its purpose was to express a feeling that the only way for civil liberties to be upheld at all resiliently is for them to be valued as universal in application, rather than seen as case-to-case judgements.
