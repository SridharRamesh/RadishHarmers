Text: Lot of pure alliteration suggestions here, all appreciated, but as "limousine liberal", "latte liberal", and "champagne socialist" are all existing terms, I'd like to fill in the blank in similar vein. (Yes, I didn't demand this for conservatives; so the situation goes.)

Text: @Sturgeons_Law Hindus never have oppressively conservative views on sex (or drugs or any such thing), no sir, that's famously not a thing that ever happens. Everyone knows the stereotype, that anything goes with those libertine Hindu elders.

Text: It will be clear why I hate everyone other than Abby. As for Abby, imagine not being white, yet thinking "show me where in the Bhagavad Gita it says that????" to be a definitive retort referencing The Hindu Bible (every religion has one; its instruction manual, its Constitution).
