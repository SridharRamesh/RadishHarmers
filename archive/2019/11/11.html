<pre>The sheer scale of a billion dollars can be hard to understand. Let me put it in perspective for you. You would have to earn a dollar a day for a billion days straight to have that much money.</pre>

<pre>I&#39;m annoyed by some health insurance stuff, Byzantine tactics arrayed by an industry of experts against me, sapping my money and more frustratingly my time, but to complain about it would only be trite content, and I am dedicated to nothing but pure originality here.</pre>

<pre>Furthermore, I must acknowledge that on some level, much of my annoyance is really at the condition which needs care in the first place, i.e. at my flailing fraying body, and here I have no leg to stand on, for who am I to question God&#39;s immaculate design? Here as in all matters.</pre>

<pre>After experimenting with recent policy changes, Saudi Arabia will no longer be taking any chances with the possibility of women driving cars, and to that end is investing heavily in Uber&#39;s two-birds-one-stone approach.</pre>

<pre>Dark on Netflix is incredibly good. Perhaps the only truly good Netflix original series, that has managed to maintain quality into its second season. I hope they don&#39;t screw it all up in the third/last season.</pre>

<pre>@yarbsalocin Of course, there genuinely is a trend in the second set of datapoints, but one that I gather is to be expected, with a reasonable and innocuous explanation. The polynomial-fitting or whatever that produces the upward lifting curve at the end of the first set is egregious, though.</pre>
