Text: One can aim for a better better world than what this mindset settles for. You wouldn't think it to be mere clear-eyed empirical pragmatism if this same style of reasoning were applied to the other Left goals you consider important.

Text: If your True Leftist response to immigrants getting massacred is to deride the very idea of permitting immigration as thus having been effectively dunked upon by reality, you're being nasty and callous and blinkered by reaching for a weird own of the radlibs.

Text: Left Twitter people are the most fun to spend time with; clear-eyed and amiable. People who've left Twitter, I mean.

Text: @HenryKrinkIe I'm being somewhat unfairly reductive, a more nuanced reading could be given of what has annoyed me, but this remains the implicature-gist of what I've been disheartened to see. I don't want to get into a more specific public spat than that, though. https://t.co/eM62GXTfKn

Text: @quasicoherence Wait, this wasn't taken tonight, was it? I should've asked someone to take my photo; it's been so long since there have been any new photos of me. I've been frozen in the same smile for like a year.

Text: @quasicoherence Don't forget how many of them also made the same rant-without-an-actual-joke about fearing Twitter digging up their old posts to cancel them. (I even agree with some of this sentiment, but when everyone on the lineup's saying the same thing, it's not an interesting funny bit…)

Text: I will never openly acknowledge horniness for anyone who doesn't actually live where I live. I keep such pointless online crushes secret, to the grave, with dignity. Like an adult. Like my father before me, in the CB radio scene.

Text: I'm too old to aspire to have children, at this point. Another dream dead. I can only hope to have children vicariously, through my children.

Text: @sigfpe Oh, don't worry, I understood even from the first post... My poor bloodline, though. I had aspired to no branch of the family tree ever extinguished; I had hoped for []([]_|_ -&gt; _|_) without having to suffer the indignity of []_|_ myself.

Text: @sigfpe Hm, the assumption of well-foundedness for all families seems pessimistic. But I suppose none of us can escape the eventual heat death of the universe, even in theory... Or am I interpreting arrows backwards from how you intended, with the well-foundedness terminating in Adam?

Text: @sigfpe Oh! In that case, yes.

The tree-properties of families (or rather, of idealized asexually reproducing ones) are of note as well beyond just wf transitivity; that any set has an MRCA/join, etc. But I imagine this is beyond being capturable in terms of the modal logic of mere [].

Text: @sigfpe Or the linearity observation that if A is descended from B and descended from distinct C, then one of B or C is descended from the other. I imagine none of this corresponds to any modal axiom on our "descent-facing" [], though.

Text: @sigfpe People actually having two parents complicates this last observation, but, yeah, I wonder if any of the properties that distinguish possible descent relations (for trees or for less asexual models) from more general wf transitive relations can be captured by any modal axiom.

Text: @sigfpe We say "parent" but really mean "ancestor", in this last bit (I could have one child and one grandchild, and then my child could die, but ◇⊤ still holds for me while my grandchild lives); a slight terminology mismatch with ordinary family terminology.

Text: @sigfpe We can flip all this around too, of course. You have living ancestors iff not all of your living ancestors have living ancestors.
