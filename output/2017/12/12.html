Text: @marx_knopfler I didn't say anything about triangles. And to be clear, I don't mean the abstract topology. But the study of pos-def quadratic forms (Pythagorean/Euclidean/whatev norm) is definitely bolstered hugely in popularity by the fact that our spacetime makes such use of a quadratic form.

Again, my point isn't that inner product spaces wouldn't come up at all; of course they'll come up in math, degree 2 forms are the next degree up from degree 1. But they'd be more esoteric topics. Mathematicians would care; not everyone.

Text: @marx_knopfler It wouldn't be a "relaxation modification of Newtonian physics that retains a lot of its present flavor", but it could well still be something interesting w/complex reproducing structures with complex interactions (whatever defining qualities of "intelligent lifeforms"). *shrugs*

Text: @marx_knopfler @xayelet Obviously everything in the universe as it exists currently is based on the rules of physics of the universe as it exists currently. Of course sound waves and heat and whatever else would be different, or wouldn't even be concepts as such.

Text: @marx_knopfler @xayelet And conversely, this counter-universe would have concepts which were not directly represented in our own. It would be, well, different.

Text: @marx_knopfler @xayelet And we'd only be ditching complex numbers in the same way that our current (3+1)d universe is "ditching" octonions or whatever, yet we can and do still talk about octonions when use happens to arise for them; abstractly, not of direct physical "geometric" importance. But, yeah.]

Text: @marx_knopfler Sure, if you define isotropy via circles… Is a vector space with no imposed norm "anisotropic"? Each direction is exactly as good as any other.

Text: @marx_knopfler @xayelet But such arbitrary units on the angles to focus on… Degrees (1/360 revolutions)? π radians (1/2 revolutions)? You would think the much more natural units to describe angles in ratio to would be full revolutions.

Text: @greend00d @marx_knopfler I disagree. Or, rather, whatever one wants to call a necessity, I should also call a logical necessity. But I am also willing to entertain many different notions of what a/the "logic" should be.

I'll tick along with my point of view, and you all can think whatever you like as well, and that can be that. Nuts to this hellthread.)

Text: @greend00d @marx_knopfler And also, these threads always remind me of my sadness at having abandoned my PhD, and my insecurities around that (or that even if I do someday finish my PhD, I will not pursue an academic career, and thus will never be an acclaimed academic with the credibility that carries).

Text: @marx_knopfler @greend00d My big hero who motivated me to go to grad school in Logic in the first place was Wittgenstein, who got his PhD at 40. But… his career is hard to emulate. I'm supposed to be publishing a world-acclaimed Tractatus about now.

Text: @marx_knopfler @greend00d (Also one of the current day biggest names in my field got his PhD at 37ish. But, it's anomalous. And academia seems like such a shitshow lottery. Anyway, I don't think it does me any career good to voice negativity publicly, so I'll save further discussion for DMs or something.)
