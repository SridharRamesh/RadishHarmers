# The RadishHarmers tweet archive.

For now, just try going to something like <https://sridharramesh.github.io/RadishHarmers/archive/2020/6/24.html>. I will eventually add proper index pages and all the other bells and whistles.

TO DO:
* Add proper indexing.
* Make things less ugly.
  * Background colors
  * The way text wraps around the avi, and general spacing relative to the avi.
* Display quote tweets, replies, and threads with links or embeddings back to other tweets on this page or to Twitter.
* Show embedded media (images and videos).
* User-selectable filters on what kind of tweets are shown (filter out replies, or show only one tweet).
