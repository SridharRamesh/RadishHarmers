Text: After dodging bullets left and right on religion, politics, sex, and my hit-and-run 12 years ago, Meltdown May will finally consume me as I bare publicly my feelings about our etiquette custom to just be cool with always coming back from folks' houses covered in their pets' hair.

Text: My four month old Macbook keyboard is fucking  up, and this is apparently a common problem. (See, just there, I didn't intentionally type a double space, it just happened. You have to believe me, these stray spaces are happening constantly,  not my fault, and driving me insane.)

Text: He doesn't sincerely think the Chappaquiddick movie should be re-shot to get the lunar phase right, guys... No need to screenshot and drag; that shows a more foolish commitment to pedantic literality from you than from him. Just let him have his Science Guy schtick fun; it's ok.
