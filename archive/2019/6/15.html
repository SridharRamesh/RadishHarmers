<pre>Music is unbearable, my favorites worst of all. Naturally. I turned ever to them for comfort through the most painful periods in my life. Too strong, the associations. I&#39;ve Ludovicoed myself out of the medium. Won&#39;t repeat that mistake. Now on, I know only to do things I dislike.</pre>

<pre>It&#39;s still crazy to me that two of the biggest names of the 90s, from completely separate worlds (Simpson from athletics and acting, Goldman from cuisine and hospitality) knew each other personally. I guess once you&#39;re a celebrity, you only hang out with other celebrities.</pre>

<pre>@marx_knopfler @RaymondMoist This is the white pronunciation I&#39;m accustomed to (and, in fairness, have often introduced myself as and continue occasionally to use in non-Indian settings).</pre>

<pre>@marx_knopfler @RaymondMoist The accurate pronunciation nearly rhymes with &quot;breather&quot;. The &quot;d&quot; in my name is perhaps strictly meant to be a dentalized plosive rather than the interdental fricative in &quot;breather&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t really matter. The &quot;h&quot; indicates aspiration, but that also doesn&#39;t matter.</pre>

<pre>For the record, my PhD/ABD actually wasn&#39;t in the Math department, but rather in Logic (full name &quot;Logic and the Methodology of Science&quot;). If I hadn&#39;t quit mid-dissertation, all the Facts and Reason folks, the entire Intellectual Dark Web, would bow before me.</pre>

<pre>A few years later, he defined adjoint functors, at the age of 30. I&#39;ve never accomplished anything. I had a couple tweets hit four digit numbers. It&#39;s a competition, and a race, and I&#39;m losing. Follow him instead of me.</pre>

<pre>Learnt today that Dan Kan knocked on Sam Eilenberg&#39;s door in spring &#39;54 to discuss some ideas he&#39;d been thinking about on his own, a week later used them to answer a question Eilenberg had asked, enrolled in grad school, and then that summer (still 1954) submitted his PhD thesis.</pre>
