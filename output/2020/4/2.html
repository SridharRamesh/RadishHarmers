Text: Even before it's over, the take will become that there is no need to change anything, no need for the systems in place to be better equipped, as a global pandemic is a freak event that won't recur. Business as usual usually works, hard cases make bad law, let's not rock the boat.

Text: @spindlypete I will admit, while Myst, Riven, and Myst III were excellent, I felt Myst IV started out exciting but was ultimately a disappointment. I finished it, but tediously, and then never continued to Myst V or whatever they're up to now. Perhaps this marks me a fairweather fan.
