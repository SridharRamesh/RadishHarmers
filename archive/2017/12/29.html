<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@FrankieG_Baby https://t.co/xcPHCTkQbo. You can search Twitter to see the deranged things people are saying should happen to the people responsible for such a mild jibe. Luckily, none of it WILL happen, but as a pro-joke person, the attitude irks me.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@investmntwanker @wcthunderesq FWIW, I&#39;ve found GCM rather ridiculous in general (e.g., unlike everyone else in these parts, I thought Fang trounced him in their debate); he&#39;s not my cup of tea. BUT, I am very pro- academics (and everyone) being able to freely voice their politics and still have job security.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@investmntwanker @wcthunderesq So this was the focus of my question; job security for academics. Even &quot;dweeby edgelord&quot; professors, or whatever offense one may take him to have committed, oughtn&#39;t be drummed out of the academy over this sort of thing, and so that is what I was curious about.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@investmntwanker @wcthunderesq Sure. To be clear, I have no knowledge of his academic work, and no judgement of it (and my main point here is he shouldn&#39;t have been made to leave his job). The things I found ridiculous (perhaps a better word is &quot;silly&quot;) were just things like his Twitter, but that&#39;s irrelevant.</p></blockquote>
