<pre>Grains of pollen from various plants as viewed under a scanning electron microscope. Observe, when we zoom in on one in particular (morning glory pollen), that it appears to be made up of six-sided faces, with three of them meeting at each spike. https://t.co/WaUytojTC9</pre>

<p>
<pre>But you can&#39;t actually make a ball using only six-sided faces. It&#39;s logically impossible (the reason why will be explained below). Indeed, if you look more carefully, you&#39;ll see that there are some five-sided faces visible as well. https://t.co/qKla794PsW</pre>

<pre>On a soccer ball, we have 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons. On our morning glory pollen grain, we clearly have many more faces. Indeed, 110 hexagons and 12 pentagons.</pre>

<pre>Can you make a ball using only six-sided faces (hexagons) and five-sided faces (pentagons)? Sure. There&#39;s one very familiar way of doing so. It&#39;s sometimes called a &quot;truncated icosahedron&quot;, but it&#39;s more familiar as a soccer ball. https://t.co/sgq15uyexG</pre>

<p>
<pre>And here&#39;s another way to make a ball out of hexagons and pentagons. A hexagon on top with six pentagons next to it, and then the same pattern again in mirror image on the bottom. So 2 hexagons and 12 pentagons. https://t.co/cWt7YM8hj4</pre>

<p>
<pre>There&#39;s another famous way of making a ball using only hexagons and pentagons; perhaps the most famous. Actually, it doesn&#39;t use any hexagons. Just 12 pentagons. It&#39;s called the dodecahedron, &quot;dodeca&quot; for those 12 faces. Pyrite crystals often take this form (albeit squashed). https://t.co/Rzu8Sx8kzL</pre>

<pre>We&#39;ve now seen four different ways of making a ball using only hexagons and pentagons, three meeting at each corner. The number of hexagons could vary quite a bit, but the number of pentagons was always 12. Coincidence? No, clearly not, or else I wouldn&#39;t have made this thread.</pre>

<pre>So, why 12 pentagons? The only reason this story is any good is to actually understand the why, but I&#39;ll let you whet your appetite thinking about it for yourself for a bit before explaining it.

(Not that any of you care; this thread is write-only, I&#39;m sure.)</pre>
