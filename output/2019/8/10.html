Text: Please do not share facts that might cause others to have thoughts about the appropriate policies for the global hegemon, if you do not yourself have citizenship within the global hegemon. This is illegitimate influence. God split the world's languages post-Babel for a reason.

Text: Even after admission to the Kingdom of Heaven, if you do not earn enough points fast enough, you don't get to climb the ladder to Heaven 2. Not to mention, membership fees rising sharply ever since the '70s.

Text: @McFaul @realDonaldTrump I don't see why we are supposed to find it sinister that RT shares this video (first shared by the Americans who took it). The racist woman in the video is sinister, but why is reporting on the video sinister? Is it sinister when NBC shares the same video? https://t.co/SSPiumMJDL

Text: I'm only human. Hardly omniscient. E.g., right now it's raining, but I'm not aware it's raining. (Joke originally due to Moore, and the subject of Wittgenstein's "On Certainty". Also anticipated to some extent by the Gödel sentence, in turn anticipated by the Epimenides paradox.)
