<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@h_ffman Making guesses for each step of &quot;Should I do u-sub or integration by parts? What should I make my u? What should I make my parts? Ok, now to keep going, what move next?&quot; is exactly the same as just guessing the answer, piece by piece.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The only integration rule you need is to be able to differentiate. The only integration technique you need is to be able to differentiate and to guess. That&#39;s all everything else is, in obfuscated form. You should also just use a computer to do it for you. It&#39;s fast at guessing.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Integration by parts? That just means guessing that the answer will be a product (possibly plus another term) whose differentiation thus uses the product rule. Sure, feel free to guess that the answer will have that form, and also to guess what one factor of the product will be.</p></blockquote>

That is a fine insight to understand, though essentially 0% of calculus students are ever shown this. (Which is fine too, because you should just have a computer do it).</p></blockquote>
