Text: @faceplant10 @liz_franczak Two black women (one African-American, one Somalian), an Indian woman, and a Palestinian woman on stage, and no one else. White male rage and misogyny personified.

Text: @neeratanden The incident you are referencing was a Palestinian woman speaking alongside an Indian woman and a Somalian woman, moderated by an African-American woman. No white males in sight; indeed, no males nor whites in sight (unless you wish to consider Palestinians toxically white).

Text: In 2020, I want to become a more positive person. But not through changing how I react to setbacks, increased resilience moving on from disappointment, etc. I want to do it through a bunch of good things, and no bad things, happening to me.
