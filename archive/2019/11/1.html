<pre>@k_shivers My sample size is 3 so far, and I cannot confirm that they are actually going out as such, but they have at least posted in such costume. If that&#39;s all it is, who am I to piss on their fun? But I hope for their sake they are switching to something else before going out.</pre>

<pre>@LEGO_Clayface @Sturgeons_Law Whoops, I forgot about the damage this would do to Sturgeon&#39;s post, but whatever. It was about people on Twitter dressing up as other people on Twitter on Halloween. I deleted it because it felt unduly snarky about harmless fun from people who ultimately are very similar to me.</pre>

<pre>@BlackScarfAFC @jeremycorbyn What counts as earnt is up to society to define, the same society that defines the constructs of property and money and wealth and so on, and the argument there should be no billionaires is the argument that such a prize shouldn&#39;t be in the game; no way to &quot;earn&quot; it.</pre>
