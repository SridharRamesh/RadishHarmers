<pre>[Bloody and bruised]
I&#39;ll never tell! You&#39;ll get nothing from me!

[I am punched again. My captor nods to his assistant, who readies a knife.]
No! No, my top 5 favorite movies are a secret I will take to the grave!

[The assistant smiles, and shortly after, my screams ring out.]</pre>

<pre>Can&#39;t stand those restaurants with signs like “No wifey here - just talk to each other like the old days :)”. I love my wife very much and will not disrespect her by bonding with others, thus starting down the road to an emotional affair. No sir.</pre>

<pre>I know I&#39;ve made a good joke when it doesn&#39;t quote or screenshot anyone and might still be funny in twenty years or two. I do what it takes to pay the bills, I make tentpoles for the studio to subsidize the rarer passion projects for myself, but I know my wheat from my chaff.</pre>

<pre>@peligrietzer @hii_nal I&#39;m not against it, but one could just as well make a whole new list, at that point. To make precisely three insertions out of 100 (and the other two so near the end) is surprising.</pre>

<pre>Whenever an alcohol marketing executive hears someone say &quot;I don&#39;t drink&quot;, why, they beam with pride. What a brand coup for alcohol, managing to capture the generic; the direct opposite of Kleenex, Xerox, etc.&#39;s woes. The advertising manager for edibles deserves a raise as well.</pre>

<pre>I don&#39;t trust autobiographies. They can be so selective; the author is too biased, including only the details they wish to be remembered. Lincoln&#39;s, JFK&#39;s, Amelia Earhart&#39;s; all leave out major, important facts.</pre>
