<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s fine by me that people post tritely about the horror of gun violence. It&#39;s not possible to have an original thought on the matter, but it doesn&#39;t bother me for people to keep repeating the old correct ones, as the repetitive situation keeps warranting.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I had no idea Marx had written on the subject! In reading his calculus papers, it&#39;s not immediately obvious to me what the intended contributions were or the background context of the era, and thus they&#39;re neither obviously good nor bad. Will keep reading. https://t.co/wsOMPOPXm0</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I suppose this is a couple decades after, but still roughly contemporaneous with, the work of Bolzano, Cauchy, Weierstrassâ€¦, and thus things like &quot;How to make conceptual sense of dy/dx, this 0/0 ratio, this Berkeleyan paradox?&quot; were in the air as not entirely settled matters.</p></blockquote>
