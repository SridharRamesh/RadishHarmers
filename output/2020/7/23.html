Text: @lingusmoron Both cars were at the same place starting at 1:30. Ending at 3:15, the faster car got to its destination.

The fast car was 1.25 = 5/4 times as fast as the slow car. That means the slow car was 4/5 as fast as the fast car. So the slow car only made it 4/5 of the way there.

Text: @lingusmoron So the slow car had 1/5 of the way left to go. We're told it had 35 miles left to go. Since 35 miles is 1/5 of the way, the full way was 5 * 35 miles.

The fast car traveled these 5 * 35 miles in the hour and three quarters from 1:30 to 3:15.

Text: @lingusmoron So the faster car's speed is 5 * 35 / (1 + 3/4) miles per hour. Which comes out to 100 miles per hour.

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie This explanation will look long only because Twitter makes anything longer than a sentence look like a monster thread. I promise the ideas involved are all simple. You just have to take the time to read them:

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie There's a lot going on here concerning powers on the left-hand side. The question is basically testing how well you understand how to simplify combinations of powers.

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie You probably already understand the basic concept of what powers mean. If I write something like p^3 [I'm using this ^ notation because I can't easily write superscripts here], I mean p x p x p. Three copies of p multiplied together.

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie In this particular problem, there's a multiplication, a division, and a square root. These all interact with powers in predictable ways. Let's walk through how those work.

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie If I multiply one power of p by another power of p, what do I get? For example, what's p^3 times p^2?

That's p x p x p, times p x p. 3 copies of p multiplied together, times another 2 copies of p multiplied together, for a total of 3 + 2 copies of p all multiplied together.

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie So p^3 x p^2 = p^(3 + 2).

Nothing was special about 3 and 2 here. It's just how combining lots of copies works. When you multiply two powers of p together, the exponents add up.

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie I want to emphasize, this isn't a random rule. You can rediscover it for yourself just by thinking about what powers mean, in terms of multiplying lots of copies.

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie If I divide a power of p by another power of p, what do I get? For example, if I divide p^5 by p^2, what do I get?

That's p x p x p x p x p, divided by p x p. We had 5 copies of p, then divided away 2 copies of p, leaving us with 5 - 2 copies of p. So p^5 / p^2 = p^(5 - 2).

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie When you divide powers of p, the exponents subtract. 

Again, this isn't a random rule. You can rediscover it for yourself just by thinking about what powers mean, in terms of multiplying lots of copies.

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie If I take the square root of a power of p, what do I get? For example, the square root of p^6?

Well, p^6 means p x p x p x p x p x p. And the square root means whatever multiplies by itself to give you that. So the square root would have to be just half as many copies of p.

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie If I multiply p x p x p by itself, I get p^6. When you take the square root of a power of p, the exponent is halved.

So these are the rules for how powers interact with multiplication, division, and square roots. Let's apply them to our problem.

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie In the numerator, we have a square root of p^5. When we take a square root, the power gets cut in half. So this becomes p^(5/2).

It might be scary that we now have a fractional power, but that's ok. Weird powers are defined so that the ordinary rules keep working for them.

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie The numerator multiplies p^2 by this p^(5/2). When we multiply, powers add up. So the numerator comes out to p^(2 + 5/2).

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie Finally, we divide the numerator by p^(-2).

That negative power might be scary, but again, weird powers are defined so that the ordinary rules keep working. 

When we divide, powers subtract. So dividing p^(2 + 5/2) by p^(-2) gives us p^(2 + 5/2 - (-2)).

Text: @lingusmoron @earl_hadtodie The question asks us which power of p we get. The answer is 2 + 5/2 - (-2).

And 2 + 5/2 - (-2) comes out to 6.5. So another way to say the answer is 6.5.
