<pre>If family or friends insist, I am willing to cook for them, with reluctance, with tears in my eyes, but I shall never, ever partake of my cooking myself. I am no fool. Right after eating a delicious meal is surely when I would be tastiest, to predators.</pre>

<pre>&quot;Soccer&quot; from &quot;association football&quot; is the most British goddamn name I&#39;ve ever heard. And they have the gall to force US to use it? The greatest trick perfidious Albion ever pulled.</pre>

<pre>Each night, I review myself qua human being, assigning presentation and technical scores, out of 6 points each. I stare at my numbers like a dieter at their scale. My therapist says this is rather unhealthy; he insists a unified ten point system would be more accurate and robust.</pre>

<pre>I don&#39;t actually think any of this means much in terms of predicting who people will actually vote for come the appropriate time (see 2016). Also, some of the margins are tiny. But in terms of upsetting the evidence for popular thinly sourced narratives, I think it&#39;s fun to note.</pre>
