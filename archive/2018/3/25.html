<pre>I suppose next, I&#39;ll be &quot;Sridhar Ramesh from Twitter&quot;, and what shall forever elude me is becoming &quot;Sridhar Ramesh [no explanation needed for this figure we all know, acclaimed already in the world at large, thereby accruing actual real-life benefits]&quot;. https://t.co/ctjWFWWDCl</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby Ah, gotcha. I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;whom&quot; is difficult to use in traditional formal manner if one cares to use it in traditional formal manner, but it&#39;s fine by me that people mock this moribund feature they&#39;ve been needlessly scolded for lacking in their own native idiolect.</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby And it&#39;s not that there&#39;s never any good reason to be confused about &quot;whom&quot; usage, even among any educated speakers, which in actual practice sometimes isn&#39;t as clear-cut as all that, as in the below. This discussion captures many of my feelings on it. https://t.co/haBgFNgkh3 https://t.co/B6L3ljo4SC</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby (I mean, I&#39;d say in these situations, there is no rule; practice is genuinely divided even among those speakers in those registers where they&#39;d use &quot;whom&quot; in other constructs. Here there&#39;s no reigning authority. People speak in varying ways. So, naturally, confusion in analysis.)</pre>

<p>
<pre>@FrankieG_Baby Is this argument against me? My whole point is there&#39;s no strong rules dictating Right or Wrong beyond the (sometimes ambiguous) usage instincts native speakers already follow, but people hear there are such rules all their lives. Thus, it&#39;s natural for them to make light of it.</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby I don&#39;t consider Geoffrey Pullum to be treating language poorly in that article, and I&#39;m surprised you take him to be treating it as algebra problems, but perhaps that&#39;s how it comes across to be an academic linguist specializing in grammar and thus discussing it in the manner…</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby natural to such. &quot;Grammar&quot;, of course, in the senes of understanding from evidence the rules which accurately describe people&#39;s language usages; that is, not to correct people or tell anyone what they should do, but simply to study and describe empirical phenomena.</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby The algebra/religious fundamentalism/etc. analogies you draw seem to me much more accurate as description of the scolding prescriptivists Pullum rails against than as description of Pullum&#39;s own conventional linguist perspective (outlined further at https://t.co/MnLQNzGZrl …).</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby You don&#39;t think someone who cares for language might care to study how people speak? These are &quot;correctness conditions&quot; not in the sense of telling people how to speak correctly, but in the sense of accurately understanding how people do already of their own accord speak. https://t.co/ihvaC2xmfA</pre>
