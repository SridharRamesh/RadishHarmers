<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@jcreed Disclaimering my disclaimer, I should say, so far as this positive and negative powers of h thing goes, it can still converge at |h| = 1, for particular x and z, so it&#39;s not completely hopeless to view the object you&#39;re interested in &quot;numerically&quot; rather than &quot;formally&quot;.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@jcreed In particular, if you understand f(x, z) &quot;numerically&quot;(/&quot;analytically&quot;/whatever the right term) to begin with, to get the h^0 coefficient of f(hx, hz) f(x, 1/h) you&#39;re interested in, you can substitute h = e^{it) and take the average value as t varies through the entire period.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@jcreed As for how tf to arrive at it, if you start verifying the formal series works out, you&#39;ll see for yourself, but basically, I start with f(x, z) f(x&#39;, z&#39;) and have to enforce the constraint that the power of z&#39; matches the summed powers of x and z.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@jcreed So first I bring in a new variable h to collect those summed powers together (turning x and z into hx and hz). And to make the power of z&#39; match the power of h, I take z&#39; to be the reciprocal of h and include only the terms where the two match perfectly to create h^0.</p></blockquote>

But you get the idea (and at any rate, aren&#39;t interested in the analytic side, only the formal side).</p></blockquote>
