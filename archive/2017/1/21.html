<pre>@sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes The specific context is just a re-illustration of how the general context is. Both Harvey and Huang just echoing many other conversations.</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes The de-masculinization of Asian men is real, we can surely all agree, and deserves pushback, just like any other racial stereotyping.</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes And those narratives ought be changed, again just as for any racial stereotyping situation. Race oughtn&#39;t cause such disparate experiences.</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes (Just as, statistically, everyone in our stupid culture does). They shouldn&#39;t do that either. Same dumb problem, on the flipside.</pre>

<pre>@sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s wrong for Asian men to worry about their demasculinized general cultural image. Anyway, I&#39;ve written too much.</pre>
