<pre>I don&#39;t think acting like a dog in public is really so explicit or horrible or tough to explain to kids. &quot;That guy&#39;s a weirdo. He likes to act like a dog&quot;. Kids won&#39;t put together it&#39;s a sex thing. It&#39;s basically Improv Everywhere. However, for this reason, it is dumb.</pre>

<pre>Get some standards. You can&#39;t be dunking on a 2K tweet from an 800 followers poster, no matter how dumb it is. You&#39;re dunking on that which barely exists. Sometimes people say dumb things. It happens too often to be noteworthy. I&#39;ve broken this rule myself, because I too am dumb.</pre>
