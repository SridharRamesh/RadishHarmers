Text: Most of your friends are women or gay dudes. You like astrology. Most of your friends like astrology. You are an astrologer's client. You experienced events in 2010, and your life is very different now from ten years ago. You will lose your right leg in a car crash on August 8th. https://t.co/mI83QmGuw0

Text: I hate this frequent take. The Fight Club guy was disenchanted with his white collar cog job maximizing car company profits by calculating the laxest safety standards they could get away with. If no one ought be unfulfilled with that and aspire to more, we're all fucked. https://t.co/eu0rnUD5DI
