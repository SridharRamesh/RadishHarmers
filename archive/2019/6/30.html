I&#39;ll note also that the counterfactuals also include other modes of being on the street, not just &quot;left-wing violent people on the streets&quot;. It&#39;s not just the violence that irks me, though it does. It&#39;s the futility of the tactics.</pre>

<pre>@johncarlosbaez Not only that, this same formula lets you define factorials for non-integers too. Letting f(n) = ∫ H_n dn, the recurrence H_n = H_{n - 1} + 1/n turns into f(n) = f(n - 1) + log(n) + C. Killing off the C and going multiplicative with n! = e^(f(n) - Cn), we get n! = (n - 1)! * n.</pre>

<pre>@johncarlosbaez C here is f(1) - f(0) = ∫ H_n dn from 0 to 1, which turns out to be the same Euler-Mascheroni constant mentioned above.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@johncarlosbaez One might imagine other, differing ways of generalizing the factorial, or equivalently, of generalizing the harmonic numbers. But just as we integrated the harmonic number recurrence into the factorial recurrence, we can differentiate to see something nice about this definition:</pre>

<p>
<pre>@johncarlosbaez Letting g(n) = d/dn H_n, we turn the recurrence H_n = H_{n - 1} + 1/n into g(n) = g(n - 1) - 1/n^2.

It&#39;s not hard to find an explicit solution to this, though: let g(n) = 1/(n + 1)^2 + 1/(n + 2)^2 + 1/(n + 3)^2 + …, which converges.</pre>

<pre>@johncarlosbaez Indeed, this is the unique solution to the recurrence for which g(n) approaches 0 as n approaches +∞.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@johncarlosbaez Defining such g, we can then integrate (again adding a suitable constant term) to recover the generalized harmonic numbers, now seen as the unique solution to the harmonic number recurrence whose derivative approaches 0 as n approaches +∞.</pre>
