<pre>Dear everyone who has screenshotted, quote-tweeted, etc, this to drag me for being incredibly insecure and unable to handle comedy: You have misinterpreted these tweets thoroughly. Your reasoning is fallacious, and your conclusions are only accidentally completely correct.</pre>

<pre>Any idiot can follow any symbol-shuffling algorithm with the rules in front of them and weak time constraints, and most can be drilled to furthermore memorize such rules and carry them out quickly with low rate of error.

But why should they have to?</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe Hm, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to drill kids on doing Kumon worksheets of 50 examples of decimal notation long division with the numbers changed, quickly and without flubs, for them to understand the concept of division, or other such things.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe And the fact that they are compelled to toil near-exclusively at such drudgery under the heading &quot;math class&quot; for years, I think, shifts the tenor of their understanding of and attitude toward math harmfully.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe So it&#39;s not about examples vs. abstractions, tho I have thoughts on that too, but rather, what are the skills/concepts we want to compulsorily instill, why are those particular ones important, do we effectively pull it off currently, and would other things be better uses of time?</pre>
