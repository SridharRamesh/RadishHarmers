Text: @neoliberal_dad @ghibliantrains In my defense, I was talking to a mathematician! The concept is very simple and could be phrased in ways more immediately understandable to others, but I was expressing it in jargon to someone who I knew would grasp the jargon.

Text: Under highly controlled conditions, I like my face, but anytime I see, like, a candid photo of me from the side or such, I get bummed out. Please, promise me, you will only ever stand at one of three chosen angles relative to me. I will be mailing out protractors.

Text: Laypeople often conceptualize pixels as perfect squares, or perhaps dots, but upon closer look, you will notice that they are in fact jigsaw-shaped. It is only through extensive hardware acceleration that rendering these together in real-time has become computationally feasible.

Text: @liz_franczak @rogerbellin For the record, though it's unimportant, GCM annoys me in basically all details, posturing and positions alike, while NJR I only tease for his audio-visual affectations; I often like NJR's actual writing, though it could indeed stand to be less verbose.

Text: @liz_franczak @rogerbellin I should say, I've only read Current Affairs; I've never had any interest in any of the other stuff he writes. Perhaps after reading "The Man Who Accidentally Wore His Cravat to a Gymnasium", I will in tears realize the error of my ways in ever engaging in this cruel mockery.

Text: @Styl_oh Audiences are dumb; they like the wrong things, or for the wrong reasons. The best you can do is make the stuff you like, have it in your pocket forever, and hope to bring some audience to it later.

Correction: The best you can do is make the stuff I like.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law @foolinthelotus @yeetphilosopher PowerPoints for working thoughts out on the fly? It feels like this backslides on the original point about the value of being able to write and draw in 2d with one's hands fluently, vs. the kinds of constrained thinking and communication that happen with linear typing as default.
