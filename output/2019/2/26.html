Text: Hahaha. "Homo erectus". Ahahaha. To be clear, what I am laughing at is only the latter part of the term; the former brings me no mirth, it is simply another valid way for a person to be, we are all children of God.

Text: Telling stories at the party, namedropping. Mostly namedropping kids from my high school. They didn't go on to anything notable, but man, they had some great names. Come to think of it, a lot of these names are just urban legends, and kinda racist. I hope I meet a celeb someday.

Text: So then I said to Wilde, "You will, Oscar, you will…". It was very witty, and again, just to be clear, I, Sridhar Ramesh, was the one who said it.
