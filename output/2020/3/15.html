Text: One dilemma with math is that often one can give a very quick explanation to a particular question, vs. a slightly slower explanation for the one particular question, that builds up more machinery that makes further questions much easier to understand. I always prefer the latter.

Text: Don't worry, I will explain why this V - E + F = 2 (called "Euler's formula", though a dozen other things are also called that) holds later in this thread.

This will be the most enlightening part of the story, that generalizes in many directions to other wonderful math.

Text: There's a certain formula that always holds whenever you make a ball out of faces (or tiles, or regions, or whatever you want to call them). 

Specifically, the number of vertices (aka, corners, points, â€¦) - the number of edges + the number of faces will always equal 2.

Text: Once we have this formula, it's not hard to see why we need twelve 5-sided faces, if we're going to tile a ball with 6- and 5-sided faces, three meeting at each vertex. Indeed, many readers who were already familiar with the above formula saw it for themselves.

Text: It's worth my emphasizing, nothing in this depends on the angles or sizes or even straightness of the faces. Make them all kinds of squashed and squiggly, but this formula will still hold. It's purely a matter of considering the structure of how the faces connect to each other.

Text: This means, if we have H hexagons and 5 pentagons, the number of vertices is (6H + 5P)/3, the number of edges is (6H + 5P)/2, and the number of faces is just H + P. So our formula tells us (6H + 5P)/3 - (6H + 5P)/2 + H + P = 2.

Text: When you see an edge between two different faces, you can erase it. This gets rid of an edge, and also turns two faces into one. So E goes down by 1 and F goes down by 1, but since they have opposite sign in our formula, this keeps V - E + F the same. It's unaffected.

Text: Of course, many things in nature do come in cubes, or use triangles, etc. But basically no viruses make capsids in this way. It's been theorized that this has to do with the superior efficiency of pentagonal faces in absorbing compression stress, vs. fewer-sided faces.

Text: Incidentally, the same reasoning says that instead of 12/(6 - 5) = 12 pentagons, we could've used 12/(6 - 4) = 6 four-sided faces, or 12/(6 - 3) = 4 triangles. Or even 12/(6 - 2) = 3 two-sided faces! So why is it pentagons that so many viruses settled on using?

Text: For some people, it might be easier to think of the Vertices - Edges + Faces = 2 reasoning in reverse from how I presented it above. Suppose you want to draw a particular diagram of faces, edges, and vertices onto a ball. Start by drawing just one of the vertices onto the ball.

Text: Eventually, you'll draw the entire diagram you intend to, since everything in it is eventually reachable from the starting vertex. And V - E + F = 2 the whole time.

Text: If you draw a new edge between two vertices you've already drawn, you increase E by one, and since this edge splits one existing face into two, you also increase F by one. This keeps V - E + F the same.

Text: At this moment, we have 1 vertex, 0 edges, and 1 face, so V - E + F = 2.

Then, on each turn, you're allowed to either draw a new edge between two vertices you've already drawn, or draw a new edge between one vertex you've already drawn and one new vertex.
