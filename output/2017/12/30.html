Text: @kathbarbadoro It is, and yet my mother and her sister both married men with the same name as their youngest brother. I dunno, I guess he was a real sexy younger brother.

Text: @oppenfailer I like him, but it's become clear talking about comedy is his true passion, what he was working towards and has now successfully moved on to, the way others pursue standup just to get a foot in the door towards an acting career or whatever.

Text: @bombsfall @haircut_hippie I did the "The New Testament..." thing, and then I deleted it worried I'd be called out as trite, but then I did it again, because, whatever, it's true.

Text: The reason you do not want to see how the sausage is made is because you will witness that it is produced simply by wrapping sausage in sausage-casing, which raises a regress of questioning which shall haunt you forever.

Text: I do believe there is good in everyone. Some of my sincerely favorite tweets, absolute favorites, have come from people who I generally think of as annoying lunks on this site.

Text: @YungCoconut Thanks. I'm ok, just lost stuff; just a pain in terms of money and inconvenience, but nothing too bad, apart from the lost laptop, whose contents were all backed up.

Text: I'm ok, got hit but not injured, just lost stuff, just a pain in terms of inconvenience.

At the moment, the least convenient thing is that my phone will die soon and I lost my only charger, so I'll soon be unable to contact anyone until morning.

Text: Apart from my laptop, there wasn't even anything there that would've been of any use to anyone else; just, like, clothes and toiletries and a bunch of special foods my mom gave me and some photos I was supposed to give to my aunt.

Text: But I guess that's often the way, or, I dunno, I've never been mugged before.

Anyway, I'm fine but shaken but fine but shaken, and going to bed.

Text: @collnsmith Oh, wow, thanks, but I feel too weird to take money from friends for a thing like this that probably happens to lots of people eventually, when others have it far worse off; I guess I lost a big chunk of $ from the laptop, but I have enough savings to be upset but buy a new one.

Text: @collnsmith Also, this happens to coincide, bittersweetly, with my being about to start a new job, which softens the blow. (Which I'll make some happier tweets about, soon enough, I guess.).

But thanks; I appreciate your looking out for me.
