Text: I suppose next, I'll be "Sridhar Ramesh from Twitter", and what shall forever elude me is becoming "Sridhar Ramesh [no explanation needed for this figure we all know, acclaimed already in the world at large, thereby accruing actual real-life benefits]". https://t.co/ctjWFWWDCl

Text: @FrankieG_Baby Ah, gotcha. I wouldn't say "whom" is difficult to use in traditional formal manner if one cares to use it in traditional formal manner, but it's fine by me that people mock this moribund feature they've been needlessly scolded for lacking in their own native idiolect.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby And it's not that there's never any good reason to be confused about "whom" usage, even among any educated speakers, which in actual practice sometimes isn't as clear-cut as all that, as in the below. This discussion captures many of my feelings on it. https://t.co/haBgFNgkh3 https://t.co/B6L3ljo4SC

Text: @FrankieG_Baby (I mean, I'd say in these situations, there is no rule; practice is genuinely divided even among those speakers in those registers where they'd use "whom" in other constructs. Here there's no reigning authority. People speak in varying ways. So, naturally, confusion in analysis.)

Text: @FrankieG_Baby But, yes, this is all besides the point that people pretending to be stupid annoys you. And also annoys me. (At times. But also I indulge in it at times, I dunno, it's all a jumble…)

Text: @FrankieG_Baby Is this argument against me? My whole point is there's no strong rules dictating Right or Wrong beyond the (sometimes ambiguous) usage instincts native speakers already follow, but people hear there are such rules all their lives. Thus, it's natural for them to make light of it.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby I don't consider Geoffrey Pullum to be treating language poorly in that article, and I'm surprised you take him to be treating it as algebra problems, but perhaps that's how it comes across to be an academic linguist specializing in grammar and thus discussing it in the manner…

Text: @FrankieG_Baby natural to such. "Grammar", of course, in the senes of understanding from evidence the rules which accurately describe people's language usages; that is, not to correct people or tell anyone what they should do, but simply to study and describe empirical phenomena.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby The algebra/religious fundamentalism/etc. analogies you draw seem to me much more accurate as description of the scolding prescriptivists Pullum rails against than as description of Pullum's own conventional linguist perspective (outlined further at https://t.co/MnLQNzGZrl …).

Text: @FrankieG_Baby You don't think someone who cares for language might care to study how people speak? These are "correctness conditions" not in the sense of telling people how to speak correctly, but in the sense of accurately understanding how people do already of their own accord speak. https://t.co/ihvaC2xmfA

Text: Milk handily turns utterly, undeniably foul long before becoming unhealthy to drink. Other foods lack such good early warning systems.

Some take advantage of this. They eat cheese and the like; they do not stop. They are mocking God's design. They are spitting in God's face.
