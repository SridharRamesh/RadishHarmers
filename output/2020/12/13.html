Text: Actually, that is a common misconception. It was my ardent debunking of the pseudoscience of astrology which earnt me the nickname "The Zodiac Killer". My spree of unsolved murders in the San Francisco area in the late 60s and early 70s is unrelated.

Text: @Hermit_Thrush I had not realized you had been in a PhD program. I wish you best of luck in still finishing your PhD someday, if you desire to do so.

Text: There's also some more specific resemblance between Church, my advisor, and me in particularly spending time thinking about function types abstractly, but what I mean by this won't mean much to anyone who isn't me.

Text: Of course there is a resemblance in that we were all concerned with foundational matters in logic, but that's just being in the same field. That's just being logicians.

Text: It would be Alonzo Church (and thus Alan Turing would be my academic uncle), if I hadn't quit in the middle of writing my dissertation. I still fantasize of disciplinedly finishing it in time for this to count, but the clock keeps ticking. https://t.co/23DWKeWUPb

Text: I don't know anything about the biz. Is residuals structure so different for theaters vs streaming? Sounds like that's the problem, then. Weird to frame the problem as that theaters might fall off and streaming rise up in a pandemic world, or any world where streaming exists. https://t.co/HYtzSmomD8
