<pre>I dunno if it&#39;s PC culture or folks wising up to formulaic old tropes or what, but it&#39;s getting harder and harder to entertain today&#39;s public. Don&#39;t take my word for it; watch any modern single-camera comedy. They&#39;re barely able to wring any laughs out of the studio audience.</pre>

<pre>Marry someone who shares your birthday. It&#39;s easier that way. One less date to keep track of. Marry them on that same day as well. Again, another anniversary now easy to remember. Make sure they die on said birthday, and, hey, cap it off as a murder-suicide. Two less dates to wor</pre>

<pre>Psst, you like to have a good time? Bingo? I&#39;ve got some cargo I need to unload; black market stuff, boards with 2, sometimes 3 Free Spaces. Ok, ok, yeah, that one there has some squares with lowercase L&#39;s instead of I&#39;s. It&#39;s a risk, but you still come out ahead. You in or out?</pre>

<pre>@aaronrutkoff Of course. You don&#39;t want to become marked to future employers as having a bad attitude about work, do you? Present yourself as a passionate worker they&#39;d be happy to hire (and, if it should suit their needs, fire), not some negative Nancy they&#39;d have to worry about!!</pre>

<pre>I do frequently miss native programs, actual full-featured desktop programs, but for simple transactional stuff like Venmo, what&#39;s wrong with websites? Why does everything have to be through an app?</pre>

<pre>Infinitely so, right up until you make a living at it, and then, like everything else, through the power of money it is transubstantiated into a respectable use of time; into an acceptable career path. https://t.co/HcUDBb7K77</pre>
