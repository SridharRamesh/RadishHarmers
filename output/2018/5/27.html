Text: Re all food arguments: Different people like different foods, the most basic fact about food to which we are all exposed in early childhood. It is why not all restaurants are prix fixe. Hell, it is why multiple restaurants exist.

Text: Musk wasn't saying (((the press))); that's something from your own mind you've inserted so you can score online "Oh no he didn't!!" points. He's clearly saying media institutions are owned by powerful people who live in a bubble, a thing lefties on here say with lament every day. https://t.co/XgqboF8PIc

Text: @brocialistmeme I'm all for how Twitter reveals how gloriously dumb and unexceptional all the people at the top of the meritocracy heap are; Musk and the like. I just wish it didn't also keep revealing how dumb the rest of us are as well.
