Text: Look, futurists, EVERYTHING'S "The Singularity". We've been through hundreds of them. Our powers of prediction are notoriously limited. "Maybe computers will get so advanced, no one will be able to predict the future beyond then!!", as though we all saw everything in 2016 coming.

Text: CORRECTION: Every evening, we stray further from God's light. But every morning, we stray closer to God's light. Different parts of the globe experience this at different times. There are also longer-scale seasonal effects re: God's light. Naturally, the secular trend is neutral.

Text: I love a well-defined function. Nothing in computers and on the Internet works this way anymore. Everyone's always trying to guess what they think I truly want, with some voodoo. What I want is the output of a well-defined function.

Text: Your Honor, years ago I recognized my open relationship with all living beings. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am free to see other people.
