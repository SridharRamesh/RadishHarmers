Text: Gaming? Listen, I know gaming. I was a big gamer in high school. Huge. Everyone recognized my prowess. As I walked the halls, they'd yell out "You're such a Game Man! Get load of the Game Man, everybody!", as well as some constructions that didn't make grammatical sense or parse.

Text: "I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO CRY ABOUT!", my old man yelled, before sitting me down and carefully drawing a VHS of "Old Yeller" from its box. He then savagely beat me with the VHS.
