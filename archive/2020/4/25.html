<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@flourmelon @L4NZHAN Right, their places of articulation are very close. The other difference is the manner of articulation, that &quot;th&quot; (voiced or unvoiced) is a fricative, while /t/ and /d/ are stops. Hence, the name &quot;th-stopping&quot; often used for this phenomenon.</p></blockquote>
