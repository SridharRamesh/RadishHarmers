<pre>Heading home from the city before midnight, to avoid turning into a pumpkin. One of those cool, hip pumpkins that dominate the nightlife scene. Pumpkins wearing sunglasses, even though it&#39;s already dark out.</pre>

<pre>RT @BethLynch2020: Yes, we want free stuff. Who the hell doesn&#39;t. Why should only rich people get the fucking free stuff.</pre>

<pre>RT @RadishHarmers: Just thought of a good joke, which I&#39;ll be keeping to myself. You probably wouldn&#39;t get it; it&#39;s an inside joke.</pre>

<pre>In terms of how I type laughter, I used to be a staunch &quot;Hehe&quot; and &quot;Heheh&quot; kid, but have over the years switched to being a &quot;Hahaha&quot; and &quot;Ahaha&quot; man. As go I, so goes the country.</pre>

<pre>@SegaTape As a child, I had a complex, highly formalized system of doing so, with which all my close friends were familiar.

As a man, I no longer distinguish degrees of laughter. Always leave your conversational partner guessing.</pre>

<pre>I bought a $45 #DCM20 ticket even though I hate improv, cowed by the etiquette of friendship, like an idiot. And what&#39;s worse, the ticket is in the form of a bracelet I have to keep wearing all weekend and explaining to everyone. Having friends sucks. Friendship isn&#39;t worth this.</pre>

<pre>I&#39;ve found it freeing to allow myself hypocrisy. And if I lob charges of hypocrisy at others, it only shows my commitment to this philosophy.</pre>

<pre>A name&#39;s just a name and people can rally around whatever, but it&#39;s still weird to me that &quot;single-payer&quot; apparently is so scary or unappealing that it had to become &quot;Medicare for All&quot;. Do people fear they might get chosen by Shirley Jackson-style lottery to be the single payer?</pre>
