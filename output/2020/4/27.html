Text: @MyoMyoriko This is actually implicit in a lot of analysis arguments, just not made explicit. For example, let us prove that any two analytic functions which agree on an open set agree everywhere:

Text: @MyoMyoriko By reparametrization, it suffices to prove that any analytic functions on the ray [0, ∞) which agree on a neighborhood of 0 agree everywhere.

Well, if they agree on all points &lt; x, for any positive x, then they have the same continuous derivatives of all orders at x and thus

Text: @MyoMyoriko the same power series expansion around x. There is furthermore some positive radius ε around x within which they both match this power series expansion, and so they must furthermore agree at all points &lt; x + ε.

Text: @MyoMyoriko This establishes our induction hypothesis for all positive x. And we establish the one remaining case of our induction hypothesis, at x = 0, by appealing to the presumption that they agree on a neighborhood of 0.

Text: @MyoMyoriko Now that the induction hypothesis has been established in full, we can invoke our induction principle, to conclude that these functions indeed agree everywhere. QED.

Text: @WeylActs I'm certainly not claiming everyone should be expected to understand everything clearly the first time they research or hear of it. I must have phrased things poorly, as many seem to think this is what I'm claiming.

Text: @donorsHATEhim If P(0) = 1/2 and P(1/2) = 1/4, then the next value in our sequence after 0 and 1/2 won't be 1/4. The next value will be P(0) + P(1/2) = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4.

Text: @donorsHATEhim But let's say what you mean to talk about is P(0) = 1/2, P(1/2) = 1/4, P(3/4) = 1/8, P(7/8) = 1/16, etc, leading to a sequence starting off as 0, 1/2, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, …

Text: @donorsHATEhim The sequence continues transfinitely. So after all of those will come the value 1 [the sum of the probabilities of all previous values, 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ...]. And then this 1 must have probability zero (there's no room left for probability to go up), and we are done.

Text: @cregslist Yes, this proves the same result in a different way.

(This also proves a more general result which the diagonalization argument doesn't prove, when we abstract a bit: https://t.co/aIQS8ad8j2)

Text: @cregslist Both the diagonalization argument and this Burali-Forti style argument establish a constructive result, I should highlight, though this point has often been confused. They both construct a specific value not in the range of the failed surjection.

Text: @donorsHATEhim It is made up in the sense all math/logic/abstract concepts are. If you're seriously objecting to it, I can explain it to you, but I'm not sure what your background is, as a starting point for explanation. What is your math background like?

Text: @donorsHATEhim The most relevant terms to look up would be things like "well-ordered" (as mentioned in the above argument) or "ordinal". The concept is the one at https://t.co/EIgsmqvBnH, though reading that section specifically is surely not the most beginner-friendly way to learn about it.

Text: @donorsHATEhim What it amounts to is, we can think of our increasing sequence as just some subset of the reals, where we get rid of the usual constraint that every term in the sequence has only finitely many other terms before it.

Text: @donorsHATEhim Instead, we only use the looser constraint that every non-empty subset of the terms has some smallest term within it (this is called "well-ordering"). This is all we need for our purposes.

This allows things like 0 &lt; 0.1 &lt; 0.11 &lt; 0.111 &lt; … &lt; 1/9 &lt; 1 &lt; 2 &lt; whatever.

Text: Lowercase zeta (ζ) is dumb. The curliness isn't doing anything. Just make it a smaller Ζ.

Lowercase xi (ξ) is dumb. Looks too much like ε. Again, relying too much on some guy's handwriting curliness idiosyncrasy. Just make it a smaller Ξ.

The rest of the letters are acceptable.
