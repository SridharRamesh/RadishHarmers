<pre>Caught between two worlds, forged in the diaspora, I&#39;m what they call a &quot;coconut&quot;: brown on the outside, white on the inside, green and hairless on the actual outside, the outside outside, which no one knows about for some reason. On dating sites, I describe my figure as &quot;husky&quot;.</pre>

<pre>I think modern social media has many deleterious effects, and social media BigCorps shouldn&#39;t exist as such. I can get behind that. But the constant &quot;Censor them, please!! Where&#39;s the manager?&quot; drumbeat from my ostensible ideological allies or neighbors irks me.</pre>

<pre>I don&#39;t think social media BigCorps (much less the government or whoever else) should be in the business of deciding what conspiracy theories aren&#39;t true and blocking discussion of them. I think people should be allowed to speculate wildly with their friends, I genuinely do.</pre>

<pre>Maybe it makes me a stereotypically Redditdude-whatever, but I like being able to question conventional wisdom broadly and publicly, and there&#39;s no workable way to maintain such freedom just for me and not for others I disagree with. I think people should be free to be stupid.</pre>
