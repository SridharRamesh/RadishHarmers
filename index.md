# The RadishHarmers tweet archive.

For now, just try going to something like <https://sridharramesh.github.io/RadishHarmers/archive/2020/6/24.html>. I will eventually add proper index pages and all the other bells and whistles.

TODO:
* Add proper indexing.
* Make things less ugly.
* Display quote tweets, replies, and threads with links or embeddings back to other tweets on this page or to Twitter.
* Show embedded media (images and videos).
* Filters on what kind of tweets are shown (filter out replies, or show only one tweet).
