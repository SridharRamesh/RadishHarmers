Text: @InertialObservr The unbroken pattern is that the integral of x^n dx from starting point 1 is (x^(n + 1) - 1)/(n + 1); note that this equals the rate of change in x^m as m goes from 0 to n + 1.

In the limit as n + 1 goes to 0, this is d/dm x^m at m = 0, which is the relevant definition of ln(x).
