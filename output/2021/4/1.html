Text: Women are so gay. They're constantly having sex with men. Women are even gayer than gay men, because they have sex with heterosexual men, who are the most traditionally masculine people.

Text: @shitshowdotinfo Sure, as long as it's taught by hippy stoners who actually understand math on some level beyond "Whoa. Far out, man". Who can give actual explanations to bring things down from vaguely awesome to clear and even obvious in retrospect.
