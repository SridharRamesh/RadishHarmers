Text: @aerialsloveppl @harikondabolu Yeah; this "It's transphobic!" arg went round with the Trump statues with tiny penises back when. I didn't get it then and don't get it now.

Text: @aerialsloveppl @harikondabolu it seems people feel it only gains moral currency as a trans issue? We don't need to frame it that way. Cis body-shaming's problematic too.
