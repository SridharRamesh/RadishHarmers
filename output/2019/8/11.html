Text: @BreakTheHuddle No. I have a right to say what I like and I will not stand for anyone trying to suppress my views. We need to make sure irresponsible speculation and illegitimate influence do not gain an audience and fester.

Text: My sincere opinions:

Someone repeats a joke multiple others have made before: Ugh. C'mon. Do better. We must strive for originality, or what's the point?

Someone repeats a joke they alone have made before: Haha. A classic. Glad to see it again; glad it's getting new exposure.

Text: Wracking my head desperately for a non-self-serving position, in order to prove I am a man of principle. Aha! I've got it! My wish and plot for my enemies to suffer marks me a true altruist. For is not holding onto anger like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die?

Text: Maybe it's not good to expose myself to every dumb thing some teenager in a world of 7 billion people says. Hopefully I keep reasonable perspective about it. At times it's fun to watch in amazement the new archetypes and phases emerging which shall make me an obsolete old crank.
