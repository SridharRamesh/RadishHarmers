Text: In the old days, movies were considered more prestigious than TV, and actors sought dearly to graduate from the latter to the former. But now, in the Golden Age of prestige television, the equation has flipped. This is why Ray Liotta does TV commercials, hoping to break in.

Text: @PaladinContent @_riqsha Aah! Sorry to hear this. I was mugged for the first time a year ago (huh, exactly a year ago in two nights) and I'm only just now getting back to relaxed normal with walking around at night. I can't imagine how on guard you must constantly feel! Ofc, I hope that's the end of it.
