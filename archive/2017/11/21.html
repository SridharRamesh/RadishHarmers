<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ok, I&#39;m doubly pissed now. First, Tom Sawyer tricks me into paying HIM for the pleasure of painting his fence. Then, in the novelization, they rename my character &quot;Ben Rogers&quot; and draw him as Caucasian!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m 8 days older than Michael Phelps, and 28 Olympic medals shorter. <br>Yeah. Things are on his side now, but at least I&#39;m not staring at a further 50+ years of life unable to continue doing the one and only thing I ever did or cared about.</p></blockquote>
