<pre>Normally, my response is just &quot;Why do professors care so much about this sanctity of grades, no room for empathy, &#39;The Cold Equations&#39; charade? It&#39;s not like grading charity comes out of your paycheck&quot;. But this guy seems even more actively hostile than the baseline. https://t.co/DaOpGaZbwG</pre>
