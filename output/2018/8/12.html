Text: Out partying? At this time of the week? Haha, you must be joking; no, no, I sleep early on Sunday nights, like a responsible adult. (And, yes, as it is after midnight, it is technically Sunday night)

Text: @rat_babby This account is locked, of course, but if it weren't, I'd retweet this. Take from that what dopamine you will.

Text: For some reason, no intro ever points out how the chromatic polynomial of a graph arises by inclusion-exclusion Moebius inversion: for each subset of its edges, consider the number of color assignments violating the differing colors constraint at (at least) each of those edges.

Text: This is a monomial in the number of colors (specifically, λ^number of connected components of the graph with all the original vertices but just those edges), and thus, by Moebius inversion, we get a polynomial for the number of colorings violating precisely zero constraints.

Text: All the intros talk about deletion-contraction at a single arbitrary edge instead, making it non-obvious the order of edge selection doesn't matter, except by virtue of happening to count colorings. That strikes me as much uglier, burying the very generally useful tools in play.

Text: This is emblematic of a more general annoyance I have, where inductive arguments/constructions are so often presented in a +1 manner in situations where it would be more illuminating to present them in a whole addition/combination at once manner, so to speak.

Text: All the standard examples people give of things to be proven by contrived induction with opaque induction hypothesis are things which could be seen with much clearer and greater understanding from different perspective.
