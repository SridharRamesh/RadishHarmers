<pre>@TibiusReynolds Exactly. It&#39;s not some coincidence; the fact there&#39;s a significant gap is itself evidence of a gendered bias in how jobs are assigned value.</pre>

<pre>@HoustonEuler Many dimensions to discrimination, and I guess you care about, at most, the one. I disagree, but, we&#39;re not going to see eye-to-eye on this.</pre>

<pre>@HoustonEuler Sweden&#39;s 15% pay gap is bad. Greece&#39;s 11% pay gap is bad. They both demonstrate existence of systemic gendered discrimination. They are bad.</pre>

<pre>@mattcasey I guess part of my pt is, focusing on &quot;pay for the same work&quot; is too narrow. One can always arbitrarily slice up what they call &quot;diff work&quot;.</pre>
