<pre>@IHateNYT I&#39;m no expert in history nor dating, but imo, this extended courtship fantasy maybe makes sense for someone you already know and like in some context.

<pre>Everyone&#39;s mentioning Super Deluxe, but some say it&#39;s bad. I&#39;m terrified to watch a bad movie. Don&#39;t know if I can risk it.</pre>
