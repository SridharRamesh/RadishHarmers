<pre>The Grizzly Man audio Werner Herzog was so keen to have destroyed featured Tim Treadwell noting repeatedly between bear-bites his love for Werner Herzog, with whom he&#39;d had an extramarital affair for years and also partnered on an unsolved bank heist.</pre>

<pre>My Doomsday cult predicts my death date, then constantly has to revise as the date comes and I remain alive. Centuries pass, and all the while I must find excuses to revise my calculations further and further back. I am discredited, a laughingstock. My adherents all fall away.</pre>

<pre>@JadeMasterMath For convenience, let n be even. Each prime power in the factorization of n choose n/2 is at most n. As n choose n/2 grows super-polynomially, it follows that the number of primes grows infinite. Specifically, there are at least log_n(n choose n/2) many primes below n.</pre>

<pre>@JadeMasterMath It&#39;s not hard to show that this lower bound is within a constant factor of an upper bound as well. Thus, the number of primes below n is Θ(n/log(n)). This is a weak form of the Prime Number Theorem that can be proven simply and elementarily, to interested children even.</pre>

<pre>@htpyFiber @littmath @JadeMasterMath Every number is a square-free number times a square; thus, the density of square-free numbers is 1/(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + …).

Every pair of numbers is a coprime pair times a same factor on both components; thus, the density of coprime pairs is 1/(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + …).</pre>

<pre>@htpyFiber @littmath @JadeMasterMath As for why 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + … = π^2/6, this is the famous Basel problem, which can be tackled in a (related) variety of ways, but I like to note that it can be seen with basic calculus. See what I wrote at https://t.co/WDSb61W0uj.</pre>

<pre>@htpyFiber @littmath @JadeMasterMath This same method generalizes to naturally yield the values of the Riemann zeta function at each even natural number, in terms of Bernoulli polynomials evaluated at π. And we could interpret these as densities of N-tuples of coprime values or Nth-power-free values, the same way.</pre>

<pre>I really bristle at Twitter unilaterally deciding I can&#39;t post or DM a link to an article, regardless of whether its contents may not be true. I bristle at allowing Silicon Valley or anyone this power over my communication. Just registering my bristle, nothing I can do.</pre>
