Text: I'd hate to be buried alive. To guard against this possibility, I request please not to have any food or drink placed in my coffin, so that I die soon if this accidentally happens.

Text: Oh, it's over Elon Musk stuff? Ah, I can think of one Twitter user who's said quite a lot worse, so far as false statements concerning others go, than an "I'm Elon Musk" joke...

Text: @sigfpe In many ways, it's rather silly and distracting to have standardized on defining elements of quotient objects as "subsets of the original object that comprise equivalence classes", instead of just "the same elements as before, but with a coarser notion of equality between them".

Text: @sigfpe (Of course, sooner or later, one will confront an object whose elements are subsets of another object regardless; with powersets, if nothing else. But as your experience notes, it can be an unduly confusing presentation for concepts where it is not intrinsically needed.)

Text: @sigfpe Should be no more problematic than having a lot of different sets! 

(Especially on re-quotiented objects, who wants to think of equivalence classes of equivalence classes of equivalence classes of…? No one actually thinks that way about them, so we can skip the pretending.)

Text: "Get rich quick scheme"? Well, sure, in some sense… in the sense that you'll actually get rich! See, what most people do is, they buy a ticket, but that's it. No commitment; they don't have it in them, they're lazy. The difference with my system is, step 2: "Win the lottery."

Text: Looking back from the distance of time, everyone is flattened. The opinions I had in 2012 aren't the same as I have now in 2018 (not just archetypally opinion-y opinions; my ways of thinking about math have changed too, and so on).

Text: I eagerly purchased So You've Been Publicly Shamed by Jon Ronson, but it turned out I had misinterpreted the title, and its general advice did not address the details of my particular situation, and indeed in some ways it only rubbed salt in my wounds.

Saboteur (1942)
Production error

Throughout the climactic confrontation at the Statue of Liberty, the statue is portrayed as grey, though the actual Statue of Liberty is famously green.

Text: "Your porn name is the street you grew up on followed by my bank account and routing numbers".

Whenever I need them but have forgotten what they are, instead of hunting through the house for a musty checkbook, I just post this, and some dumb sap gets scammed into helping me out.

Text: It's time I come out and admit it: I, uh… I'm a feet guy.

I know! Everyone here mocks us! But, argh: I generally find women who have feet more attractive than women who lack feet. (Just one of those paraphilias; I can't even remember what formative experience made me this way.)
