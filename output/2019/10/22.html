Text: @scotteverett I make little attempt at privacy online, and certainly my college years and institution are not a fact about which I have any need for privacy; it might as well be as public as my birthday or my mother's maiden name. That said, uh, why do you ask and how are you partially aware?

Text: If you stick 2x1 dominos onto a rectangular MxN grid, with no overlap, however you like, till there's no space for another domino, you will cover at least 2(MN - 1)/3 squares. Supposedly, if M and N are both &gt; 1, we don't even need the "- 1", but I don't see how to prove this.
