Text: @negrosubversive You likely know this already, but for anyone else who's curious to read more about the linguistics, the technical term (for the first of these uses of "be" in AAVE, and atop which several of the other more complex uses build) is as a marker of "habitual aspect".

Text: @negrosubversive Yup, I was just about to say (as you already were noting), this plus copula deletion (aka, "zero copula") result in inattentive white people thinking "be"s can be either inserted OR removed willy-nilly, instead of appreciating the actual systematic grammar in play.

Text: "Queso" can mean for some a specific cheese dip (not just cheese generically) and "salsa" can mean a specific sauce style, and sometimes people say "pizza pie" instead of just "pizza", and if you understand all of these phenomena, then you are capable of understanding "chai tea".

Text: "Chai tea" is the style of tea known in many parts of the world as "chai", after the word for tea used by those who typically make tea in this style. It makes perfect sense. If you've ever said "pita bread", it's exactly the same thing. It's fine.

Text: Does an individual have a hip or does an individual have hips (two, I guess)? Somehow, the answer isn't clear to me.
