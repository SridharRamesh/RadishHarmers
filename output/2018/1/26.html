Text: @yungneocon I can handle some non-linearity, but the reversals rather strain the metaphor.

Text: ðŸŽ¶ Won the lottery and died the next dayâ€¦ ðŸŽ¶: Uh, where's the irony?! Try a dictionary, sweetie.

ðŸŽ¶ Sitting on a cornflake, expert texpert choking smokers, I am the egg man! ðŸŽ¶: Yes. Yes, all spot-on examples of being a walrus. Ah, to pen such profundity; truly the last greats.

Text: @rogerbellin Or perhaps in triteness. (I can't be too harsh; there are worse sins, and who am I to cast the first stone? https://t.co/1dFlTiI2mG. But I'm hours into the onslaught nowâ€¦)

Text: @rogerbellin Speaking of which, it is also, each time, a powerful education in how little having a post that does numbers actually provides satisfaction or matters for anything. In that sense, it is a very useful lesson in my own stupidity, to be the dog that catches the car.

Text: @rogerbellin The sweet spot for a tweet is where all of my friends like it, and I also make two new friends. Beyond that is grating; beyond that, I am in fact forced to doubt the quality of the tweet, and conclude I missed the mark.

Text: @IHateNYT I remember that but, I'm ashamed to say, I cannot remember if I even gave it its proper Like at the time. Well, if I was a coward then, mistake corrected now (and if not, benefit from Twitter's buggy double-counting loophole).

Text: @ZakDavid @quasicoherence Perhaps "self-awareness" is a red herring; at least the ability exists for somebody to debug software at some level, the ability to have a perfect description of the rules of its execution, which is far beyond any ability which exists for anyone (man or machine) to debug a human.
