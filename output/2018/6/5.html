Text: I could totally get in on the meme du jour, since no one understands what mathematicians do. But it would be dishonest for me to pretend I do things. At the moment, in true mathematician style, all my doing is merely hypothetical.

Text: @quasicoherence I was ashamed of it even as I posted it, though perhaps for different reasons. All wordplay is a corny, childish mistake.

Text: Look, I'm not actually very well-read; I skim a novella every three or four years. These glasses fool people. I didn't get these glasses by reading too much as a child; these aren't reading glasses. These are videogames glasses.

Text: The Chelsea tweet seems fine to me. A celeb dies, so, as folks do, she looks for a connection to them when expressing condolence; some way to honor their accomplishments, to note some happiness their work put in her life. And in Spade's case, handbags are her famous work, right?

Text: @trash__fire @rogerbellin Ah, glad to see another productive use of everyone's meeting time (to be clear, I didn't assume they were actually implementing telepathy; I was waiting for the other shoe to drop).

Text: @brocialistmeme @VR0NLINE Well, digitized data is in some sense easier to preserve; you just keep doing file copies onto the new physical medium du jour. Hence, the natural popular assumption.

Of course, that won't happen. And digitized data is also easier to lose entirely into the ether all at once.

Text: @brocialistmeme @VR0NLINE (And, in fairness, in many ways, we don't want our corporate overlords to be storing all this data anyway. There's a tension there, that I'm not yet sure how to resolve my feelings about.)

Text: @brocialistmeme @VR0NLINE In fairness, I also worry about all the earlier VCR home movies, etc. I went through and digitized a fair chunk of mine a while back, whatever I could find and still play, but ultimately, whatever the state of tech, everything's a losing battle; things get lost, we must let go.

Text: @brocialistmeme @VR0NLINE Well, SOME mosaics persist... I'm not sure how the percentages compare. (I'm clearly really not sure how I feel about this, except that I wish it were easier to preserve things forever that one wants preserved forever)

Text: This is meaningless, isn't it? Tax funded wealth redistribution programs just require new taxes? It's all just numbers in a computer somewhere. It's not that there's a big pile of grain that's emptying. It's whatever pie-splitting power dynamics we choose. https://t.co/f3I1Sv5zXx

Text: Couldn't figure out SoundCloud, so let me just describe it to you: a bass drum, then a rest, then I put in another bass drum. Then comes, I think it's called a snare drum? A high synth note, and then a low synth note, and the drums are still going at this point, of course, increa
