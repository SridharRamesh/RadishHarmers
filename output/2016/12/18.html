Text: @ZachWeiner 0d: two points. 1d: circle. 2d: sphere. 3d: so-called "3-sphere". Etc. (Look up "n-sphere" for more)

Text: @ZachWeiner By n dimensions here, I mean n dimensions locally along a surface, which is embedded in (n+1)-d flat space. Reindex if you like.

Text: @ZachWeiner @pizzaUNOFFICIAL Just consider the set of points whose squared coordinates sum to 1. This defines it in any number of dimensions

Text: @Samaliel @ZachWeiner A natural pattern is point, segment, filled circle, filled sphere. But for hollow circles, etc, pattern is as I said.

Text: @Samaliel @ZachWeiner In math jargon, this is distinction between "circles"/"spheres" (hollow) vs. "disks"/"balls" (filled).

Text: @carlosgnfd Yes, but note that "0d = center" is only the case with 0 radius. And 0 radius in any dimension is just as well just the center.
