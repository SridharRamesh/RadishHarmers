<pre>How do I spend my time? I do not make a fuss. I sit quietly and I stare at the wall. Hours later, to keep boredom at bay, I turn and stare at the next wall. After exhausting all four walls, it is time to lie on my back and stare at the ceiling. Next morning, the cycle continues.</pre>

<pre>I&#39;ve forgotten why I have the particular set of interests I have, having developed them so long ago, but now I&#39;m stuck with them. I will not be switching horses midstream.</pre>

<pre>I hear of far future dates (Election Day, or when the next season of some series I like hits TV, or whatever), and think &quot;Aw, that&#39;ll take FOREVER to come…&quot;.

<pre>@christapeterso Is there a reason you need to use subscripted &quot;r&quot;s so often that you have a shortcut for them? Or do you have similar shortcuts for each other letter as well?</pre>
