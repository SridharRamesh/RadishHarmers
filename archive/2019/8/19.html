<pre>I didn&#39;t really like OUATIH, it was a bit too plotless for me (and when things finally do happen, it&#39;s only just the same ending we&#39;ve seen before several times now). Not that interesting. But wow, some people have been trained to give such weirdly dumb criticism instead.</pre>

<pre>I may give it a rewatch just to see if it grows on me. Knowing ahead of time not to expect much plot often helps me enjoy this sort of movie more. I expect I still won&#39;t get much interesting out of the ending; it was fresh in Inglourious Basterds, now it&#39;s too rote.</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby The ending violence is pretty boring to me, but not on &quot;A fictional man shouldn&#39;t attack women(??)&quot; grounds. Also, the scene with Bruce Lee was one of the more interesting parts to me, yet folks are angry the Asian wasn&#39;t shown in just a flatly reverent way, drained of character.</pre>

More generally, in order to visualize space with D many dimensions, I simply visualize an n-dimensional space, and then set n to D.</pre>

<pre>@ILikeCereal13 Yes, those are the ones I&#39;m referring to. I liked the ending in Inglourious Basterds, where it was a shocking surprise. I was already bored of it by Django Unchained, which I thought was a much lesser film. I&#39;ve yet to find many who agree with me, though. To each, their own.</pre>

<pre>They should combine all the awards into one, given to just the single best person or thing each year. If the year&#39;s best makeup for a single-camera series (non-prosthetic) is better than the year&#39;s best chemist, give it to the makeup. Everything else is rewarding mediocrity.</pre>
