<pre>There was a while there when kids were doing great on the SAT: 2200s, even 2300s! A bright and hopeful future lay ahead of us. But now they&#39;re all back to rarely cracking 1500; a generation of drooling morons. I blame fidget spinners.</pre>

<pre>Well, I started it off with seven scattershot but, I think, insightful posts, and I&#39;ll keep going from there. I&#39;ll wait till I&#39;ve put up a lot more content before actually letting anyone see it, though. Launch with a bang rather than a whimper. Maybe some more organization too.</pre>
