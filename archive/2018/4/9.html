<pre>Anyone can make anything and share it with the world immediately, but near no one will see it unless it happens to get on TV or into top papers, or happens to curry the favor of Facebook. Distribution&#39;s never been cheaper; centralization remains powerful. What a time to be alive.</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby Sure, let folks get rid of their tweets, absolutely. I&#39;m just saying, indicate that a tweet is missing, so the tweets from other people in a thread that remain don&#39;t look like nonsense in reply to different tweets than they were originally replying to.</pre>

[Insert any photo I&#39;ve ever posted to Twitter, or that anyone has, or any photo that exists anywhere. Almost none are normal graduation photos. I acknowledge this nascent meme&#39;s existence, but I have nothing to add. My well is dry.]</pre>
