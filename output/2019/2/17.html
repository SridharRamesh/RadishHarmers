Text: In case you care about my opinions, I often agree with a lot of the people here who often disagree with a lot of the people here I often agree with, but one thing I disagree with them about is open borders, which I am 100% in favor of (and, indeed, 100% against being against).

Text: @matthewaraven In practice? I know it will not be implemented soon in any capacity, much as the world does not implement many of the things I want.

In the form I endorse? Anyone could move worldwide as easily as from CA to NY. "Citizenship" as a concept beyond current residence withers away.

Text: @matthewaraven I'd say I see it as something that morally should be implemented as soon as possible, but which won't be. As analogy, this is also how I see single-payer healthcare in the US at the moment; I am pessimistic it will happen soon, but I endorse it and consider it a moral necessity.

Text: @matthewaraven I also consider it a moral necessity for countries to individually open their borders, even if others have not yet.

Text: @matthewaraven "mutual agreement" doesn't come into it; countries shouldn't have immigration/emigration restrictions, is how I feel about it. Countries having emigration restrictions is immoral. Countries having immigration restrictions is immoral.

Text: @matthewaraven Yes. Of course, there are a million other policies I want as well, and if I don't get them things will be worse than what I want. But even if I don't get them, yes, I would support this.

Text: @matthewaraven Given the status quo, yes, this is likely for some such workers, unfortunately, just as it is likely to have positive effects on the wage bargaining power of many workers presently denied ability to move to America.

Text: @matthewaraven I think everyone is morally obligated to find a way to do their wage bargaining in the regime of open borders; not all tactics for one's personal bargaining power are morally acceptable and should be given enforced support, at cost to other workers.

Text: @matthewaraven Why should I limit my considerations to only the benefits of those workers presently in America? For the closed borders regime has negative effects on the wage bargaining power of all workers who wish to move but are denied; I cannot see how restricting their movement helps them.

Text: @matthewaraven As noted, I would like to see other policies put in place in addition to open borders. But, yes, enacted in a vacuum with nothing else changing, open borders will hurt some workers and help some other workers.

Text: @matthewaraven Are we talking about what should happen or what will? Because I acknowledged it is unlikely to happen soon. But in terms of "should", narrowing focus to the specifically American working class ignores an awful lot of people whose experiences in the world matter just as much.

Text: @matthewaraven This is how it often goes; enacting single-payer in a vacuum wouldn't be great for every single worker in the status quo either, some of whom work at private insurance companies at the moment, alas. An argument oft put forward for not disturbing the status quo in that situation…

Text: @matthewaraven But even denied further policies, hands tied, I still would consider it a morally necessary change for the future; I could hardly wait till everyone in the world is in position to sign on. Nothing would ever budge.

Text: @matthewaraven I don't think the problems capitalism inflicts on the third world are because residents of the third world are allowed to leave if another place will take them. Have emigration restrictions benefited the residents of such countries as don't or didn't permit residents to leave?

Text: @matthewaraven Is it better for the first world to continue doing all that and for people to be unable to flee? I've already said I want lots of other policy changes, of course, but hands tied on those, I still want freedom of movement, as much as I can get.

Text: @matthewaraven In the closed borders regime, the same division of the world's working class and ensuing resentment still arises, just differently geographically located, the migrants now not having migrated and harboring their resentments at those who are able to have what they were denied.

Text: @matthewaraven I don't see that depreciating the power of the would-be migrants is so much better than depreciating the power of their first-world competition. The problem is that the world runs on competition at all in the first place.

Text: @matthewaraven But hands tied to not address that larger systemic problem, I don't consider it moral to enact the very selectively beneficial aid of restricting third-worlders' movements. I don't consider it moral for anyone to restrict anyone's movements.

Text: @matthewaraven Nothing will fix all suffering caused by capitalism except addressing the root problems of capitalism itself. But freedom of movement is a value in itself, every bit as much as higher wages are a value.

Text: @matthewaraven If closed borders are so great, we could close borders even further, of course, We could legislate that the poorest regions in the U.S. should no longer be able to send their top-of-the-lower-heap workers as migrants into competition in other regions.

Text: @matthewaraven Sure, it hurts those top-of-the-lower-heap workers to have their movement restricted, but it benefits their competition elsewhere, their remaining presence will be of use to the communities in the poorer regions they would leave, etc, etc.

Text: @matthewaraven Alas, I must leave the thread for now, perhaps thus unfairly granting myself the last word, in order to attend to other chores I've kept procrastinating. (And when I do return, it will be all dumb jokes and frivolity from me again for a bit, as is my wont.)
