<pre>There was this kid Tom in 5th grade who was way taller than the rest of us, and every time I see Tom pop up in a Facebook photo or the like, I still think &quot;Good old tall Tom; God, he&#39;s tall&quot;. Tom is under six feet; everyone else just hadn&#39;t had their growth spurts yet, back then.</pre>
