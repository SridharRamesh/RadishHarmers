Text: Enter the portal and kill baby Hitler? Nah, man, the consequences could be disastrous. I don't fuck with changing the past. Tell you what, though: I'll keep an eye out and kill any current infants I come across, just in case. An ounce of prevention and all that.

Text: I cannot respect any dumb herd-follower who would get Japanese writing permanently marked onto their body despite having no understanding of the language. It is why I avoid eating Kobe beef.

Text: In 2019, I want to become a more positive person. But not through changing how I react to setbacks, increased resilience moving on from disappointment, etc. I want to do it through a bunch of good things, and no bad things, happening to me.

Text: I hear of far future dates and think "Aw, that'll take FOREVER to come…". As finally they arrive, enough calendar ❌s later, I feel pride, like I've accomplished something, like it's to my personal hard work credit.

Text: The No Country For Old Men "sipping the tea" clip makes me laugh and laugh. But, it is such a clear example of how little of all this Twitter humor (a sensibility I've surrounded myself with and hitched my wagon to) will age gracefully, too. The ephemerality of what's funny.
