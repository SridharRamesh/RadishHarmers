<pre>@sponson Yes, AT&amp;amp;T owned Bell Labs (not anymore, but did at the time). I never meant otherwise; I meant &quot;invest&quot; just in the generic sense of allotting money towards something, not in some specific sense of purchasing shares in a business entity one doesn&#39;t fully own, or whatever.</pre>
