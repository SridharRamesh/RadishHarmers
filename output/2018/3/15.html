Text: @bridgietherease Welcome back! Sorry to hear you've been having a rough time, and I hope things are better or at least getting better now.

Text: I haven't had a hangover in six years: 1997, 2003, 2006, I think 2011… This tweet is a lie, I largely quit drinking when I was 24, but I couldn't think of a better frame for delivering this wordplay mechanic. The joke still stands. It'd sell like hotcakes in bumper sticker form.

Text: Would've been a coin flip which sex got all world power, but men have more upper body strength and are a bit taller on average, so it went to them. Eons ago, it was settled on the savanna, and thus still today, the significance of reaching the high shelf and opening tighter jars.

Text: Everyone poor, everyone suffering, deserves amends up to a high quality of life. They needn't have had any particular offense committed against them or their family to qualify. Poverty is the offense. Suffering is the offense.

Text: Waitaminute. College sucked. I only tried to convince myself otherwise because a bunch of guys from the '70s (who went to college in the '60s) spent their adult lives churning out movies like Animal House.

Text: Every person who was young in the '60s never got over it, and saddled the rest of us with their hangup. If you can remember the '60s, you wrote a screenplay about it.

Text: My pal with the greatest romantic luck told me he generically first-messages on Tinder with "I have something urgent to ask you!", thus successfully sparking reply and conversation, and now I hate all modern courtship rituals. I can't be pursuing my love life like a 419 scammer.

Text: At a hair salon, each different stylist wears a very distinctive, outrageous, idiosyncratic style of haircut, and each is attending to a customer who they are giving the same distinctive, idiosyncratic style of haircut. Draw it up and make it a New Yorker cartoon.

Text: "My sadness fuels my comedy; the way I see it, my job is to cut myself open on stage, telling it like it is…" —Comedian, at top of documentary about them; this line is shortly followed by footage of their act, comprised entirely of passable impressions and puns and the like.

Text: Many of my posts were intended be New Yorker cartoons, but I never learnt to draw, or where to submit New Yorker cartoons. (What's that mnemonic again? I believe it was something like "Write to me, 'Stace Tilley, P.O. Box 963; New York City, New York State, 10108"…)

Text: Let f_N = (d/dx)^N cos(x^½). Note f_N = P(y)f_0 + Q(y)f_1 for y = 1/(4x); P, Q integer polys of deg O(N). But |f_N(x)| ~ N!/(2N)! as N → ∞. Given this super-exponential decay, set x^½ = π to conclude 1/π^2 irrational (more generally, tan(z)/z rational ⇒ 1/z^2 irrational). QED.

Honestly, for all their generic boringness, their lack of sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of the app, at least those much-maligned rubes whose first thought is "Hi" are being human.
