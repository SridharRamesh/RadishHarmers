Text: But Popeye... The spinach was just a ploy to make you believe in yourself! The strength was in you all along‚Ä¶

Honestly, your ability to just squeeze unopened cans so hard that the spinach within popped out into your mouth? That should've been a giveaway.

Text: @mckinleaf @queerthief @thomas_violence @mxrigg The 18 triangles all have the top point as their top corner, and then two lower corners at the same height; there are 3 choices of which height the bottom corners are at, and then 6 ways to pick two of the four points at that height to be the bottom corners (thus, 3 * 6 = 18).

Text: @mckinleaf @queerthief @thomas_violence @mxrigg In your 19 triangles, are any not of this form? Are any double-counted? If you list out your 19 triangles, it will be easy to see which are different from the 18 others count.

Text: I once balanced one Snapple bottle upside down atop another Snapple bottle, then quickly grabbed the bottom one away, with the top one remaining balanced after it hit the ground. It was awesome. I think about it each time I see a Snapple. This was in 2003. I've never tried again.

Text: @KRASNEROCALYPSE Heh, yes, I saw that, and it was with regret I pushed forward anyway. I keep thinking minor wording tweaks will cause this to take off and be appreciated at the level it deserves. (I think so of every post of mine which does not take off to grand acclaim. Of my IRL actions, too.)
