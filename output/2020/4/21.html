Text: @3hotpeople Like many of my posts, this does not express my sincere opinion. For what it's worth, I tend to work within classical logic fairly rarely. You may be the target audience for this. https://t.co/TTvXTh9Pfh

Text: @sigfpe It becomes perhaps more vexing if phrased as:

N₁: The natural number defined as 1 + N₂, or 0 if N₂ isn't well-defined.
N₂: The natural number defined as 1 + N₃, or 0 if N₃ isn't well-defined.
N₃: The natural number defined as 1 + N₄, or 0 if N₄ isn't well-defined.

Text: @sigfpe Intuitionistic logic would allow escape from that, but not from defining each C_k as the well-founded set of things successfully defined by C_i for i &gt; k, as indices range over the natural numbers. A sort of variant presentation of Burali-Forti.

Text: New Yorkers furious at all the "Why I left New York" pieces, defending their choices to stay in the city. Same as ever. Same grumbling happened in 2019, 2018, 2005, 1995… Cool young people think they'll never grow old and settle down. The discourse never changes.
