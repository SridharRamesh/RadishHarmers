(Interesting etymological side note: &quot;screwed the pooch&quot; is a bowdlerization of &quot;fucked the dog&quot; created by Tom Wolfe for The Right Stuff, the story of the first fighter pilots selected for the U.S. space program, who fucked dogs.)</pre>

<pre>@yeetphilosopher Define accuracy however you want. The string of N results you get from sampling from probability distribution D a total of N many independent times has a probability distribution determined only by N and D, and not by any here unmentioned concept of &quot;the population size of D&quot;.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@yeetphilosopher So any function of that string of results and the original distribution, any such notion of accuracy you like, is determined only by N (the sample size) and D (the population proportions for each possible result), not at all affected by the absolute population size.</pre>

<pre>@yeetphilosopher If you&#39;d already be happy with sampling with replacement at a given N, then sampling without replacement at that N only shrinks the distribution of sample averages closer to the population average.

<pre>@reezels For the purposes of this post, a sample of size 250 means that 250 times in a row, you go draw a random person from the population and record what their properties are. There is a chance you draw the same person more than once.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@reezels Now, 250 samples, allowing repetition in this way, would probably strike you as pretty useful for gauging the proportions of Yes and No among 10 people; not guaranteed to hit the proportions right on the nose, but a generally trustworthy way of getting likely very near them.</pre>
