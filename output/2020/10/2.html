Text: @Hermit_Thrush @pisslorde This homework was not routinely returned to the students, so there was no significant feedback given by grading it. It was purely a ritual, in all the math classes I assisted in teaching. That said, yes, my motivations were not altruistic but lazy, and thus capricious.

Text: @Hermit_Thrush @pisslorde This capriciousness is ubiquitous in the grading process, I've seen it in every test-grading room I've been in as well. Trying to assign specific numbers with more than just private feedback consequences to every little thing in the learning process is folly.

Text: @Hermit_Thrush @pisslorde I can tell in ten minutes in office hours if you do or don't understand something, and where the lack of understanding lies, much better than the whole make-work ritual accomplishes.

But there's so much broken with the math class ritual, there's no space for it in tweets.

Text: If you die as a kid, you're a kid in heaven. If you die when elderly, you're old in heaven. If you die with a cold, you have your cold in heaven. If you die before you retire, you have your job in heaven. If you die before you get to heaven, you have to stay on Earth in heaven.

Text: They will make a movie in ten years honoring the diligent moderators staying up late, manning the boards across multiple monitors, giving it their all to suspend everyone who says "Oh my god, it's happening!!".
