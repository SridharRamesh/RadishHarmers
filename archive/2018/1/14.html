<pre>@twitersgoodboy @MichaelRobnalt Twitter search is honestly really bad now, much worse than it was not even that long ago. I constantly cannot find tweets with Twitter search that I later confirm did indeed exist. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.</pre>

<pre>@twitersgoodboy @MichaelRobnalt Yup, I&#39;ve noticed that as well! But even when I do that, I still often end up not finding particular tweets that did indeed exist, even as other tweet matching the keywords may pop up.</pre>

<pre>@sodburger There&#39;s no more to it than that &quot;Thai Pongal&quot; sounds like &quot;Tide Podgal&quot;.

(Full disclosure: as a substandard Tamilian, I&#39;d never really been aware of the phrase &quot;Thai Pongal&quot; before today, but apparently it&#39;s a standard way of referencing the holiday with reference to its month.)</pre>
