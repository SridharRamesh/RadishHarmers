<pre>At last, after such careful planning, I break into the inner sanctum of celebrity, the Hollywood power circle. I take a moment to steady myself on the bully pulpit, then begin canceling celebs left and right, before ultimately, as authorities arrive, turning the cancel on myself.</pre>

<pre>Why does anyone watch or discuss the Grammys? When ever in your life have you felt they&#39;ve gotten things right, that you should produce such gnashing of teeth if they don&#39;t choose your fave now? As award-baubles go, my grandma&#39;s &quot;World&#39;s #1 Grammy&quot; cup carries more credence.</pre>

<pre>I&#39;m seeing a lot of Beck hate on the timeline. I have no idea what his current output is, but I daresay he has made enjoyable music in the past. It&#39;d be more reasonable to hate paying attention to awards shows, the idea of looking at it all as a big competition, etc. Who cares?</pre>

<pre>@TKM255 He&#39;s a Scientologist (raised as such by his parents). It falls firmly under &quot;Disappointing, but also, I don&#39;t care&quot;. I&#39;m 100% able to separate art from artist in this case; I wasn&#39;t looking to him for religious guidance.</pre>

<pre>When I was 7, I spent 10 days in hospital on an IV drip with mastoiditis. As such, I found myself eating hospital food each meal. It seemed exotic delicacy, this foreign white cuisine. Pickles made of… cucumber?! To this day, I still kind of think of gherkins as a fancy treat.</pre>
