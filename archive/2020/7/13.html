<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@truerphilosophy This is the thing I mainly am asking for people to check whether they can explain: Why can&#39;t a prime divide a product of other primes? Why is it that if you take two values which aren&#39;t divisible by prime p, and you multiply them, the result can&#39;t be divisible by p either?</p></blockquote>
