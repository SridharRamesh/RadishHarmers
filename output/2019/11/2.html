Text: Every time I've made a stock figure "he" instead of "her", or said "girl" instead of "woman", it was for character count reasons. I trust you understand similarly for the ethnic slurs and that one thread where I explored in detail my theory that the handicapped are "faking it!!".

Text: @enr0n_hubbard We're the same person. But there are worse things than being a gaping idiot void of ego and unwarranted self importance, who thus allows oneself to feel pleasant at times.
