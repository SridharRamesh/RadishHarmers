Text: I race against baldness to meet the love of my life. My own particular biological clock. All the while, hairs keep falling like petals off the Beauty and the Beast rose.

Text: When people or things are described as S-Tier, it's because they're equally as good as me. They tie with me. I myself am S-Tier as well.

Text: When a nonagenarian bucks 99% of their cohort to vote lefter in every primary than your parents or any elder you've ever loved, then votes lesser evil in the general (no shitfit on your FB or anything, just answering when asked), they're cancelled. Not good enough. Get wrecked.

Text: I disagree with each human on at least one issue, including past and future me. It is a relief on occasion to be able to bend without breaking, particularly when the bend demands no change in action from me, just countenancing someone else's variant opinion existing in the world.

Text: Men are like this. Women are like this. Ladies need to do this. Fellas mustn't do this. Dudes rock. Men are the worst. Mars. Venus. Perhaps I've made poor choices in who to follow, but I fear there's no escape regardless. People eat this shit up even after millennia of the genre.

Text: It is irksome how every little thing becomes fodder for some battle of the sexes bullshit on this site. Why is everyone so keen to be an ancient standup hack? I will not name examples; I can retweet this on any given day and you can scroll up and down to find five fresh ones.

Text: @delmoi Of course that's what it is, and I am yelling at the sea. But as far as I'm concerned, sure, maybe it's fresh when you're 16 if you haven't been paying attention your whole childhood. But by the time you're in your twenties, it can hardly be fresh to anyone not living in a cave.

Text: I will henceforth be making new alts for each new post, so those who like that particular one needn't be disappointed to also see others not to their taste. My brand purity guarantee. All to be retweeted regularly to their self-selected fans, of course.

Text: I waste lots of time online, but in my defense, each site I frequent is run by professionals whose sole job is getting me to do just that. Why would I be better at willpower than they are at their career?

Text: I only ever get anything done by announcing convoluted but concrete rules. Till I'm 35, after any day I post, I shall not post again till I've written a page of math, or a page of sketch or other real comedy. A page is nothing, I've written many pages before, should be easy.
