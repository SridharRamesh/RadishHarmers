<pre>The word &quot;sinusoid&quot;, describing an undulating bendy curve, is derived from the Latin word &quot;sinus&quot;, meaning &quot;bend&quot;, &quot;fold&quot;, or &quot;curve&quot;. …But not by the route you&#39;d think.</pre>

<pre>@sodburger I set my expectations way down, dreading the rote boredom it would surely be. And thus I was able to enjoy it ok; my moviegoing experiences tend to be largely a function of my expectation-setting. Here, archival footage of precisely what I said upon returning from the theater: https://t.co/vehMDKNMC6</pre>

<pre>@sodburger But, of course, I was in a theater, with no opportunities to pause and go off to do other things, so I got through it in a mere two hours. Like ripping off a Band-Aid; that&#39;s my moviegoing philosophy.</pre>

I&#39;ve no desire to re-read it, but it&#39;s there.</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby @MCRideordie What&#39;s interesting is how sine/sinus, which was originally applied to this concept thru a mistranslation (confusing separate Arabic words) came, centuries later w/the invention of analytic geometry and function-graphing, to be quite apropos, in a way no one considered at the time</pre>

<pre>@sodburger I think one of the things I liked at the time, which I think I saw somewhere wasn&#39;t unintentional, is that at times he let his character come across really poorly.

<pre>@sodburger (That quoted tweet isn&#39;t perfect because it&#39;s about fiction, but the same principle applies; I don&#39;t mind watching unlikable characters be unlikable. Unlikability (stupidity, cowardliness, etc.) is an interesting, ubiquitous phenomenon, which stories might as well reflect.)</pre>

<pre>@sodburger Anyway, I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m &quot;defending&quot; the movie. My praise really just comes down to: &quot;By expecting to completely hate it, I was able to not. It was not the worst film; I didn&#39;t have to leave the theater in the middle&quot;.

I don&#39;t actually recommend anyone see it.</pre>
