Text: You shouldn't read Marx. The impact of his work is lost on the page. It must be viewed in its originally intended form, staged as plays.

Text: @Yocean14 @The_AmandaK @YouSaidWhaaattt @meganamram I'm a POC sketch comedian. "If I had a time machine, I'd go back in time and kill Hitler and all of the Jews and gypsies and gay people" is a funny joke, the sort of playing with logic and tropes and frisson that is perfectly standard for a joke.

Text: @Yocean14 @The_AmandaK @YouSaidWhaaattt @meganamram My aim is not to defend Megan Amram. I don't care if I'm undermining her words now. My aim is to defend the joke.

Text: @hellolanemoore I agree. Seeing so many people openly protesting the authorities, disobeying police and the like, is maddening. Do our third grade gold stars even mean anything anymore?

Text: @abcdentminded Consider a circle as made up of lots of thin concentric rings: a center point, a ring around that, a ring around that, and so on. These rings grow linearly in length as we go further out.

Text: @abcdentminded If we uncurl everything, laying these rings out flat one atop another, we get a right triangle, whose height is the total thickness of the rings (the radius of the circle) and whose width is the length of the largest ring (the circumference of the circle).

Text: @abcdentminded So the area of a circle is the same as the area of a triangle as high as the radius and as wide as the circumference. 

You can put two such triangles together to make a rectangle of the same height and width, so the area in question is half the radius times the circumference.

Text: @abcdentminded People happen to use the letter π for half the ratio between the circumference and the radius, so we can also say the area is π times the radius times the radius again, but whatever, this letter doesn't matter. The above story is what matters.

Text: @abcdentminded The same story works in higher dimensions too. We can think of the inside of a sphere as made of a bunch of shells. If we uncurl these shells and lay them atop each other, we get a pyramid, whose height is the radius and whose base area is the surface area of the sphere.
