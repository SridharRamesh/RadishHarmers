<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@tommyxtopher I know it&#39;s not using the slur, but I&#39;ve always wondered (in a not at all disingenuous, unfair way) why a person would chose to tweet that word, when not tweeting it would do just as well. https://t.co/FcDtFFNOjl https://t.co/NWiwSutK6b</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@sigfpe If X terminates, then PA proves &quot;If X terminates, then P terminates&quot;. Also, if X terminates, trivially, PA can prove &quot;X terminates&quot;. Conjoining these, we see that if X terminates, then PA proves &quot;P terminates&quot;, which furthermore would imply that P does in fact terminate.<br><br>So…</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@sigfpe We&#39;ve now proven that if X terminates, then P terminates. This simple proof can be carried out in PA, so PA proves &quot;If X terminates, then P terminates&quot;. This causes X to indeed terminate. Which implies, by the reasoning of the previous paragraph, that P does indeed terminate. QED</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@sigfpe You may wonder: Ok, if P terminates, it must be because it finds some PA proof of P&#39;s termination. What&#39;s the proof it finds?<br><br>And the answer: It depends on the particular search-strategy P uses, but unless something else pops up first: it finds the proof given above, duh.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@sigfpe Put somewhat more strongly: the above is a constructive proof of &quot;P will terminate due to the existence of a PA proof that P will terminate&quot;. And, when worked through, we find that the PA proof of P&#39;s termination that this constructively establishes to exist is… itself.</p></blockquote>
