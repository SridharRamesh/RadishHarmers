Text: @historyinflicks @lhfang @TweetMeBalls Being a Nazi in beliefs isn't entirely the same as matching the historical Nazis. The historical Nazis were also possessed of actual power.

Text: @historyinflicks @lhfang @TweetMeBalls I'll happily call Spencer a Nazi, sure, but… What is the point of wasting time in street scuffles with ppl who have no actual power anyway?

Text: @TweetMeBalls @al_pastor_tacos @historyinflicks @lhfang Absolutely. And the kind of power it has is wielded by politicians, businesspeople, etc. Not the nobody kids who get punched with glee.

Text: @TweetMeBalls @TheDotP @al_pastor_tacos @historyinflicks @lhfang Sure, they're confused kids too. My point isn't particularly to hector them (they're not listening to me anyway; they'll do what they want)…

Text: @TweetMeBalls @TheDotP @al_pastor_tacos @historyinflicks @lhfang I'm just irked by their gleeful celebration by some I admire who I think lose sight of what is/isn't effective in yielding political change.

Text: @leducviolet @historyinflicks @lhfang @TweetMeBalls Right, but I have skepticism that the trolls there is so much panic regarding are of any plausible likelihood to come to genocidal power.
