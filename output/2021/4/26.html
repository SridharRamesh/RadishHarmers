Text: This sketch was extrapolated from a tweet I made in 2016. That is the purpose of my tweeting, laying such idea seeds for myself, to later revisit and build into something of grander ambition. https://t.co/SqRtcyK9Nq

Text: They should combine all the awards into one, given to just the single best person or thing each year. If the year's best sound editing is better than the year's best physicist, give the Bestie to the sound editor. Everything else is rewarding mediocrity.

Text: How is anyone funny or interesting for decades? I used up all my ideas within my first three years of adulthood. I've had to move and make all new friends every three years since.

Text: @littmath Oh, ok. The nLab can often be made fun of, but this case seems unfair.

Text: @littmath People are making fun of it for saying "A differential equation is an extension problem in a smooth topos along a morphism that includes an infinitesimal object into another object.", but it doesn't say that on its page for Differential Equation.

Text: @littmath On the nLab page for Differential Equation, it opens with "A differential equation is an equation involving terms that are derivatives (or differentials).", which is very apropos.

Text: @littmath The quote about smooth topos extension problems is an observation way down in the middle of the nLab page for Synthetic Differential Geometry, which also seems apropos.

Text: @littmath Which ones would you like me to look at? I'm not seeing many wild ones. I'm mostly seeing laughing at the quote for being ridiculous. There's some "I love CT" or "Why are you booing me?" QTs that I think basically amount to joking about it, but I don't even see many of those.

Text: @Seamus_Malek Recently, The Irishman and Solaris (alright, technically a tad short of three hours). Both a bit too devoid of interesting plot for me. Earlier in life, there were plenty. Lawrence of Arabia, etc.
