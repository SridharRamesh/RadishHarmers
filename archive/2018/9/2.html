<pre>Those parables where someone says God&#39;s name just as they die, accepting Him into their heart and thus going to Heaven no matter what they did in life. That&#39;ll be me, halfway into shouting &quot;Goddammit!&quot; in violent scorn at my irksome children when the raging heart attack kicks in.</pre>

<pre>The world&#39;s first Civil War re-enactment troupe, established in 1862. The troupe&#39;s combination of acting talent and poor judgement sparked the Second Battle of Bull Run (also known as the Battle of Second Manassas).</pre>

<pre>Actually, that is a common misconception. It was my ardent debunking of the pseudoscience of astrology which earnt me the nickname &quot;The Zodiac Killer&quot;. My spree of unsolved murders in the San Francisco area in the late 60s and early 70s is unrelated.</pre>
