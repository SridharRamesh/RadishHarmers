Text: Every Buttigieg sentence is just him saying some word and its opposite in close succession, to simulate the feeling of poetry, not that of prose. The man is an empty suit, and full of shit.

Text: Why does everyone talk about it as though you have to put 58008 into a calculator and then turn it upside down? You can just as well put 80085 into a calculator with no need to turn it around. You only have to turn a calculator around to do stuff like 0.7734 or 5318008.
