Text: Times Square = times times times = Time Cube. Once I fully flesh out the theory and master time accordingly, I will travel back to 2002, where this last reference would be appreciated.

Text: Free meals at school for any child who maintains at least a 3.0 GPA. Various programs of "GPA credits" for those from disadvantaged households. Decades down the road, the "Fight for 2.0". Pragmatists note sympathies, but stress hard realities of the world, suggesting 2.5 instead.

Text: @delmoi To be clear, what I am wowed by is the username "Rebecca Schoenkopf, Wonkette Editrix, King of You". I haven't yet read any of the rest of these screenshots, but they look intriguing.

Text: Stopped beating my wife yet? Huh? What wife? ‚Ä¶Oh. Oh, I see what you're getting at; I see your presumptuous ploy. It's the 21st century, bud! She and I don't need to get married just to fit your hidebound image of the ideal battery. Our progressive approach is doing just fine.

Text: Feel like I'm developing new moles all the time. Do folks actually report them to doctors to check out like they advise? I can't even be sure what's new. No idea if this mole on the back of my hand just appeared or if it's been there forever. Should've been paying more attention.

Well, it wouldn't be a very good universal observation if it didn't apply to me as well, would it?

Text: Posting longer text as images is a hack, and once Twitter applies ad hoc cropping in ways that aren't obviously cropped, changing the perceived text, it becomes such a painful one. (+ lack of search, etc). I give up on what I was just trying. Forget it. Bring back macroblogging.

Text: I'm not proud of my occasional low-effort, low-hanging-fruit tweets, but I do them the way an actor manages their career. One post for the studio, then several posts for myself, then another tentpole, subsidizing a few more critical darlings, and so on, forever alternating.

Text: A lot of misanalysis starts with the idea money is a THING you have, so taxes take something away from you that was yours in the first place. But money isn't really a THING you have (especially at high wealth levels, $ isn't primarily some bag of material goods in your garage).

Text: [Granted, part of your will one may be less deferent to is "No one gets to use this huge boat but me.". But, again, this is a small part of how exorbitant wealth materializes. A billionaire isn't someone who uses thousands of yachts. What they have is $1,000,000,000 of power.]

Text: Money (property, ownership, etc) is a relationship, of how others are to treat you. It's not taking things away from you, as such; it's choosing to be less deferent to your will for how to command the world.

Text: "Medicare For All" is eventually going to pass as a program with all the shittinesses of actual Medicare, as some buy-in program on top of but not replacing private insurance. All still a boondoggle of forms and ùò§ùò©ùò∞ùò™ùò§ùò¶s. It'll just be words. Dems will celebrate for decades.
