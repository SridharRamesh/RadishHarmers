Text: My entire life, whenever I've gotten an itch, I've scratched it. Yet, I still to this day get itches. "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result." —Albert Einstein (1879 – 1955).

Text: "And ANOTHER THING…", I shout into the mic, red with passion. "If I ever met Trump, I'd show no mercy. I'd punch him RIIIIGHT IN THE FACEEEE!!". Stunned looks from the crowd; confusion and shock. Finally, one replies "Whoa! How the hell did you hold a silent E like that?".

Text: "I have a number of serious problems with the crime bill. But one part of it that I vigorously support is the Violence Against Women Act." —Sanders, 1994

This is the ugliness the Bernie Bros have rallied around. He wanted it enshrined into law.

Text: They used to say a black man couldn't be the president. Now, they say a woman can't be the president. Personally, I think anyone could be the president. For all I know, you could be the president. Or am I? I haven't been checking my mail. I've been busy. I hope it's someone else.

Text: @Bodyisturd Experiment results:

Six weeks off Twitter: Quite pleasant!
Half a week back: Logorrheic, compulsive need for validation, numbers, stimulus. Distraction from real-world accomplishment.
Another week away: Hey, this is nice again.
Couple days back: Hm… There's a pattern here.
