Text: @ShanKothari A llion is 10^(3 * (1 + n))/n [in the short scale, and 10^(6n)/n in the long scale], for a contextually dependent n.

A llio is 10^(3 * (1 + n))/n^2 [in short scale, and 10^(6n)/n^2 in long scale].

A lli is a division by 0 error; put another way (backwards), it is ill-defined.

Text: First off, the Vanity Fair bit was obviously perfectly fine, innocuous, anodyne, has been distorted, etc.

But even if it weren't, how horrific to crave a society where one tiny problematic-on-reflection quip about a powerful figure is grounds for grovelling and rolling of heads.

Text: Every comic knows you try lots of things, sometimes one doesn't work, you regret it, whatever.

Defenders of the powerful of the status quo calling for the rather less powerful to be punished flamboyantly for the audacity of mild jibing, whether or not on the mark, is disgusting.
