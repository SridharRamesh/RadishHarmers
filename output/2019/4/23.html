Text: Classic rock band performing, audience starts singing along, rock band relents to let audience sing a line, then two lines, then the audience takes over the instruments too, the engineering, the roadies, the whole show. Audience fucking groupies, the works. Madness. Unacceptable.

Text: Argh, no, for the tenth time, no. It was precisely in order to stave off any potential charges of Holocaust denialism that I arranged those ads in all the major papers in the first place, featuring my photo with the caption "BIG BELIEVER IN HOLOCAUSTS".

Text: Spider-Man this, Spider-Man that. Psh, big deal; I could take that guy any day. It'd be a walk in the damn park! MY incident left me with the proportional strength of a creature twice as strong as a spider, and ten fucking times as large.

Text: Forgive all debt; I don't care. Erase the economy, it's fine by me. It's all made up. Make it up nicer. That'd be fun. I haven't thought this through, but I've thought enough about plenty of other things; let me have this.
