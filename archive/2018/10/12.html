<pre>The timing details of the order of operations are quite sensitive. Yes, multiplication comes before addition if you use Toom-Cook or faster; however, Karatsuba just misses the threshold, and the schoolchild quadratic method&#39;s so slow even additions of unrelated terms precede it.</pre>

<pre>RT @oldfriend99: My ear, nose, and throat guy would love nothing more than for me to believe that &quot;they&#39;re all connected&quot;.</pre>

<pre>&quot;Say it ain&#39;t so, Joe!&quot;, cried the boy. He wept to see &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson wearing shoes.

&quot;Me babe, steppin&#39; out. Into the night. Into the light&quot;, explained Joe. &quot;I stepped into, into another, into another world. There was no light. Michael Jackson is my son&quot;. Harder weeping.</pre>

<pre>The CIA&#39;s own internal documents prove that Cock and Ball Torture is ineffective, and yet they refuse to adhere to guidelines prohibiting it.</pre>

<pre>The key to a career which is both long-lasting and fulfilling: one tweet for the studio, then one tweet for myself, and so on, forever alternating.</pre>

<pre>Spoonerizing &quot;pleonasmic encomium&quot; into &quot;neoplasmic meconium&quot;, I deliver the sickest burn in Oxford Union history. Open weeping can be heard. After two storied centuries, the society shutters its doors forever, a bittersweet note lamenting &quot;There are no worlds left to conquerâ€¦&quot;.</pre>

<pre>For each of my responsibilities and long-term goals, I would like one year with nothing else I have to do but taking care of that one. I&#39;ll get this whole thing solidly licked in under a decade.</pre>

<pre>Fine, I&#39;m going to go two weeks without self-retweeting. Perhaps it will force me to come up with new gold, perhaps it will send me to my grave. (I will still self-quote as opportunity permits.)</pre>

<pre>Judge me not by my follower count. Judge me by my coefficient in the limiting eigenvector distribution of the stochastic matrix representing the follower-followee relation (my PageRank, as it were).</pre>
