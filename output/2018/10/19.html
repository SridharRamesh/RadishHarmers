Text: Philosophers have already considered every thought, every line of reasoning I reach Johnny-come-lately. Each position I hold seems monstrously ignorant to them; haven't I considered the counterargument of so-and-so's paper from when, and the wealth of literature in its wake?

Text: Breaking up is always hard, but extricating myself from this polycule one by one has been especially so. Each time I'm on freedom's verge, someone objects I didn't say "UNO", and I'm back in again. Fucking and sucking and shaking my fist in rage, swearing I'll remember THIS time.

Text: I waited till 1990, when You Can't Do That on Television went off air, to first say the words "I don't know". I also avoided the names of any liquids. My parents were worried by my slow language development; an aide was arranged who slowly taught me "water", Miracle Worker style.

Text: The most blinkered consensus opinion on this site is that MadTV was good, a buried gem. The show with Stuart, Ms. Swan, etc? MadTV was a mix of tons of misses and tired gags and occasional hits just like SNL, whose reputation is buoyed only by not being literally actually SNL.

Text: Each day, oscillating between highs and lows, optimism and pessimism, I have my moments of clarity, but no oracle to confirm for me which they were, no visible distinction from their opposites. I look back later and still don't know which moods to trust.

Text: Who would I describe as my influences? Oh, a variety of figures across various fields; mathematics, entertainment, political movements. I'll just name a few: Alan Turing, Ernest Hemingway, Abbie Hoffman, C. P. Ramanujam, Phil Ochs, Kurt Gödel, Mark Rothko, and Hunter S. Thompson.

Text: Having been born with no depth perception, I found playing with Matchbox cars on the street as a child to be a harrowing experience.

Text: @sigfpe I'd be curious to hear what your concerns with applications/interpretations of probability theory are. (As you may recall, I have my own, but probably different ones)

Text: Chidi is far too jacked for a neurotic philosophy professor. Trust me, I know the type well. I will be submitting this to IMDb as a production error.

Text: @jcreed Don't beat yourself up. This is a common blindness. Millennia of humans didn't realize "Things fall to the ground" and "The moon orbits the Earth" as the same fact, till Newton had his, er, groundbreaking flash of insight.
