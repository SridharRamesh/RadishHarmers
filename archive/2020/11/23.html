It seems everyone feels they&#39;re much less safe than eating outdoors, but if the windows are unsealed, are they actually so much worse and why? I am curious.</pre>

<pre>In 4th grade I was curious what algebra was, so I got a book from the elementary school library. It discussed abstract structures, associative, commutative, etc properties, permutation groups (illustrated as tire rotation patterns), &quot;algebras&quot; as associative algebras, and so on. https://t.co/iv3X3oxrxd</pre>

<pre>It was years before I realized this wasn&#39;t what &quot;algebra&quot; ordinarily means (either in the associative algebra sense or the broader abstract algebra sense), that middle school algebra wouldn&#39;t be about this, that there&#39;s just all these different meanings of the word.</pre>

<pre>Just such rudiments as I noted above. Nothing on homomorphisms as I recall. I don&#39;t even remember the word &quot;group&quot; being used. But permutations under composition were illustrated as an example of an associative structure (again, notably illustrated as swapping tires on a car).</pre>

<pre>And words and concepts like &quot;associative&quot; and &quot;commutative&quot; I learnt there, and finite tables were given defining abstract operators and inviting the reader to check which properties they satisfied, culminating in this definition of the word &quot;algebra&quot; as some ring-like structure.</pre>
