<pre>This is a much more interesting question for COVFCOV or COCOCO or such strings which can overlap first and second instances, but as written, the answer is a mean of 26^7 characters up through the final character in the first occurrence.

<pre>To see this, yes, we can use martingales, or we can simply note that it takes a mean of 26 letters typed to get 1 letter into the desired string (&quot;C&quot;), which in turn must be done a mean of 26 times to get 2 letters in (thus taking a mean 26^2 letters total to get to &quot;CO&quot;), etc.</pre>

<pre>For overlappable strings, mean time to first occurrence increases, relative to non-overlappable strings of the same length. [Specifically, mean time to first occurrence is the sum of 26^n over all positive lengths n such that the first n characters match the last n characters]</pre>

<pre>Intuitively, this increase is because failures along the way get worse: e.g., if one is trying to build ABC, is 2 letters in with AB, and next gets a wrong letter, one may get knocked down to still 1 letter in (if the next letter is A) rather than 0 letters in. But if one is…</pre>

<pre>trying to build ABA, is 2 letters in with AB, and gets a wrong letter, there is no partial salvation; one is necessarily knocked all the way back to 0 letters in.</pre>
