Text: @FrankieG_Baby @funnyordie @ZalesJewelers Good stuff, but there seems to be some consistent glitch around 0:56 where the video freezes and the audio drops out completely for a bit?

Text: Performing complex calculations to figure out which race I should be dating. Going to take some time to work this out. Time and intense focus; I will have to put other activities (partying, social media, dating, travel) on the back burner for a while as I reckon the figures.

Text: Still shocked each time mufos post "Studying for finals!" or some shit. Shock and a little worry, as to the arrested development it indicates for me to have surrounded myself by this niche. I don't belong here. I belong in the DM discussing 401(k) management and lower back pain.

Text: When I first came to Twitter, there was some follow-policing thing going round that scared me off, to this day, from following any of the Cum Town guys. But I'll admit: often, when one of their posts gets RTed or Liked into my TL, for my eyes accidentally to see, I find it funny.

Text: One or more of them are going to turn out to be sex creeps, and people will say "You should've known. It was obvious, from the work", and at that time, this tweet and its ignorant arm's-length appreciation will be my downfall.

Text: I don't even know who all three of them are. I've never listened to their podcast. I'll readily state that I find the name eye-rolling and puerile. As you look back on this foolish tweet in a year: believe me, please, this is all a big misunderstanding.

Text: Animals are sooo cute when dressed up to look like various kinds of people. But the people they're made to look like? Eh, whatever, who cares; they look like that all the time. (I have no sympathy for them or their plights.)

Text: I'm terrified of folks drawing accidental, unintended links across unrelated tweets I happen to post in succession, spinning Dupinesque theories about my mindset to my detriment, even as I know, in my own Dupinesque deduction, that no one else is paying that much attention to me.
