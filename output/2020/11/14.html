Text: One has to do with exponentiation. PEMDAS/BODMAS makes it look like exponentiation takes precedence over everything else. This is wrong. The notational convention is not for 2³ ⁺ ⁴ to be interpreted as 2³ added to 4.

Text: The actual notational convention for exponentiation is that the base of exponentiation is the shortest expression possible (in 1 + 2³, the base of the cubing is taken as 2, not 1 + 2). The power doesn't need any such convention to parse. It's explicitly delimited as superscript.

Text: This shortest base convention also clarifies how to read iterated exponentiation. PEMDAS/BODMAS doesn't offer any clarity on this. But in an expression like below, the base of the squaring is taken to be 3, not 4³, so the whole expression is read as 4 raised to the ninth power. https://t.co/54zgp9yqiq

Text: The other fact PEMDAS/BODMAS tries to convey has to do with strings of +s and -s. PEMDAS/BODMAS makes it look like addition takes precedence over subtraction.

But everyone soon learns "Actually, ignore the mnemonic, you should do addition and subtraction together left-to-right".

Text: The convention with a string of -s and +s is that these are punctuation separating all the values to combine. Values directly after a - are subtracted or negated, the rest are added. You can use whatever order you want, just keep track of what's subtracted/negated and what isn't.

Text: The bother is just, in a string like -3 + 4 - 5 + 6, how far does the scope of the negation or the "thing being subtracted" go after each - symbol? Does this mean to take 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 and negate it? Does this mean to take -3 + 4 and subtract 5 + 6 from it?

Text: Even this isn't quite right, though. It's not that addition and subtraction must be done left-to-right. If you look at 3 + 4 + 5 and decide to add 4 to 5 first, and then add 3 to that, you're doing something perfectly fine.

Text: Where there would be ambiguity otherwise:

1. Multiplication takes precedence over addition/subtraction (My ASs)

2. The base of exponentiation is the shortest thing possible.

3. +s and -s are separators, and you subtract what has a - in front of it.

Text: In -3 + 4 - 5 + 6, the 3 and the 5 are subtracted, and the 4 and the 6 are added. You can combine these four values in whatever order you want. 4 minus 3, then subtract 5 from that, then add 6 onto that. Or 6 minus 5, add 4 to that, subtract 3 from that. Whatever you like.

Text: And something like 1÷2π? Here's the deal. No one uses ÷ outside of elementary school. It's like writing "Congreſs". It's archaic. If you see a ÷, you're talking to someone who never actually reads or writes math. Again, all bets are off on what they mean. You'll have to ask them.

Text: No, no one needs to tell you this, because there's no other way you could have read it. There's no such thing as adding 3 - (4 on the one hand to 5) on the other hand. 3 - (4 isn't a thing and 5) isn't a thing. You'd never have read it this way anyway.

My ASs, shortest base, and subtract what has a minus sign in front. Just know those three.

But programming languages aren't what PEMDAS/BODMAS is generally taught in the context of, they often disagree with each other, and your best bet is to look up your language's rules.

Text: @ilovetorelax It's an ambiguously written question. It's exactly like saying "Bob doesn't get along with Jack because he's rude. Who is the rude one, Bob or Jack?". If someone says that to you, the only thing to do is to ask for clarification on what they meant.

Text: If you think there's a right answer, you're wrong. It's ambiguous, PEMDAS/BODMAS/etc notwithstanding. No one actually writes this way, so there's no clarity what it means. It's just as ambiguous as "Bob doesn't get along with Jack because he's rude. Is Bob rude or is Jack rude?".

Text: @realMaxBern The PEMDAS rules aren't real. They don't reflect the real way people talk, including professional mathematicians. PEMDAS was made up by schoolbook manufacturers, not mathematicians. Mathematicians never sat down and agreed to PEMDAS. Your teachers lied to you. That happens.

Text: @Spammyjazzhands @foxalive555 @Hegelbon There's no right result vs. wrong result. It's ambiguously posed. Nobody actually writes likes like this so it's impossible to know what was intended. Of course, all that's actually intended is to get people arguing with each other.
