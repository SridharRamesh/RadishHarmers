Text: RT @RadishHarmers: Say what you like about her, but Sarah Cooper has the most spot-on impression of Trump's voice I've ever heard.

Text: Why are you all so willing to say somebody else deserves such deference from you? As though you've ever had a positive helpful interaction with them in your life, and yet still you are so sworn to them. I don't have any novel insight to share, it's just always frustrating.

Text: @just_takes I'm 35, but to be clear, when I said parents or such, I didn't mean anyone with kids. I meant my parents or such. Also, of course, there are older people who aren't pro-cop, but I don't run into them, and I suspect the aggregate statistics on views by age do play out in this way.

Text: I'm tired of all these comedies clearly put together by giant writers rooms into a bland amalgam with no distinctive voice. It was a breath of fresh air to watch Sarah Cooper: Everything's Fine with its just one credited writer, Donald Trump.
