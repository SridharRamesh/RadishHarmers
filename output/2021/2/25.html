Text: Biologists don't all read Darwin. Mathematicians don't all read Gauss. There's lots of books in the world. Lots of people have found ways to present the same ideas over the years, to various tastes. Let a hundred flowers bloom.

Text: The fixation on reading the ideas just as they were written by one particular guy a century and a half ago is so silly to me. Do it if you like, read something else if you like. For most subjects, it's not the case that everyone reads and clicks with the same one textbook.

Text: @horatioalgorthm Yeah, I do it sometimes for fun. It can be interesting, in the exact same hundred flowers way. But I'd never make a big deal about "You need to read the original Gauss to get quadratic reciprocity. You're missing out if you're only reading later expositors", such silliness.

Text: @TheHarmDoer Manner of presentation matters hugely in math/science, but regardless, with any subject's manner of presentation, there are many choices in the world by many authors which people might click with. Why should it be that everyone goes for the same one manner of presentation?

Text: @jeremylevick I just don't think there should be a state specifically oriented around the identity of being friends with a man of Indian descent but withholding vaccines from him. It irks me in some ways.

Text: @jeremylevick Forgive me if I don't find your grandpa's story heartwarming. For generations, my people have been denied the COVID-19 vaccine by your people.

Text: @BrotiGupta I was sent from the future to prevent the pandemic which mutates and nearly extinguishes humanity, but I discovered Twitter and got distracted.
