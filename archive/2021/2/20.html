<pre>@luminescentorb It&#39;s certainly also possible to get paneer masala without bell pepper, of course (I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s bell pepper). I don&#39;t mean to say that that&#39;s not common either, just that both are common. And if you prefer pepper-less, go for it, I&#39;m all for people liking whatever they like.</pre>

<pre>@luminescentorb I&#39;m of the philosophy that everyone has their one food that utterly disgusts them, and that&#39;s fine. (It&#39;s fine even if they have a hundred foods that disgust them, but particularly, I think it&#39;s just an empirical fact that almost everybody has their one).</pre>

<pre>@luminescentorb Grow or not, who cares? People make too big a moral issue out of &quot;picky eaters&quot;, as though they don&#39;t have their own likes and dislikes in every other facet of life. As though they watch every movie and befriend every person and eat every substance on Earth for dinner.</pre>
