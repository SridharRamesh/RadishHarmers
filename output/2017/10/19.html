Text: @sigfpe Did (1-e^(-∂))f = ∂L, where ∂L = log x, and derived Stirling's series. Amazing! I'll have to think more about what this tells us rigorously.

Text: @sigfpe Right; this approach can get you convergent Newton (or power?) series for the whole Hurwitz zeta function (or rather (s - 1)ζ(s, q)).

Text: @quasicoherence @sigfpe Extensional properties/relations/operations just depend on what their inputs refer to (their extensions), not how their inputs are specified

Text: @quasicoherence @sigfpe with an unsolvable symmetry group" is prime. The property of being known prime by my kid cousins is intensional, not extensional.

Text: @quasicoherence @sigfpe Of course, most of the time in math we only talk about things extensionally. But there are occasions otherwise.
