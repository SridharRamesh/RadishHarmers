<pre>@nntaleb @blackmilosevic Consider first y^(n - 1)/(1 + y)^n, for fixed n. At what value of y is this maximized? Taking its derivative, we get (n - 1 - y)y^(n - 2)/(1 + y)^n, which is zero when y = n - 1. Thus, it is maximized at y = n - 1, making its maximum value (n - 1)^(n - 1)/n^n.</pre>

<pre>@nntaleb @blackmilosevic Next, since y^k is an increasing function of k, this tells us y^k/(1 + y)^n is &amp;lt;= (n - 1)^(n - 1)/n^n, when we restrict k to natural numbers less than n.</pre>

<pre>@nntaleb @blackmilosevic Finally, if we replace y with (y/x), and then multiply both sides by x^n, we get the inequality as stated.</pre>

<pre>@nntaleb @blackmilosevic Typos in the above (alas, Twitter has no editing for these little things):

Where I wrote a derivative of &quot;(n - 1 - y)y^(n - 2)/(1 + y)^n&quot;, the last exponent should have been n + 1.

When I wrote &quot;multiply both sides&quot;, I meant &quot;multiply numerator and denominator&quot;.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@nntaleb @blackmilosevic The original reasoning presumes y is at least 1. After y is replaced with y/x, this becomes the presumption that y is at least x, and we can always swap x and y to achieve this without loss of generality.</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>@nntaleb @blackmilosevic But a better conceptual approach that illustrates further generality is this:

The left hand side is invariant under rescaling x and y by the same factor, so let us rescale them to make x + y = n. Then the inequality is equivalent to showing that y^k x^(n - k) ≤ (n - 1)^(n - 1).</pre>

<pre>@nntaleb @blackmilosevic We&#39;ll show more generally how to optimize x^j y^k when x + y is constrained to a constant and j + k is also constrained to a constant. From this, we&#39;ll know how to bound the expression in question.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@nntaleb @blackmilosevic Note that the x and y derivatives of x^j y^k are this expression times j/x and times k/y, respectively. These must be equal if we&#39;re to optimize this expression while x + y is constrained to a constant. Thus, x and y must be in the same ratio as j and k.</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>@nntaleb @blackmilosevic Thus, we are optimizing an expression proportional to j^j k^k, with j + k constrained to a constant.

This is an exponential function applied to the Shannon entropy of a probability distribution with probabilities proportional to j and k.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@nntaleb @blackmilosevic And Shannon entropy famously is maximized by making j and k as far apart as possible.

In our case, j and k are constrained to be positive integers which sum to n, so they are made as far apart as possible by setting one to 1 and the other to n - 1.</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>@nntaleb @blackmilosevic As we saw that x and y must be in the same ratio as j and k, and we constrained them to have the same sum n, we find that x and y must take the same values 1 and n - 1 accordingly.

Thus, our maximum achievable value is 1^1 * (n - 1)^(n - 1), which is what we sought to show. QED.</pre>

<pre>@raktagulikaa @nntaleb For what it&#39;s worth, the last inequality here is a standard inequality as well. Letting p = k/n, q = 1 - p, and taking the negated logarithm of the left-hand side, it is the Shannon entropy of a {p, q} Bernoulli variable.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@raktagulikaa @nntaleb A standard result is that this entropy decreases as p and q move further apart. The furthest apart we&#39;ve allowed ourselves to make the two exponents is 1 and n - 1, so the value in this case bounds all others.</pre>

<pre>@zlingray This isn&#39;t all language. This is just the Indo-European language family. Linguists generally don&#39;t find proposals for larger language families to be well-evidenced. But there are very clear systematic correspondences in this particular family.</pre>

<pre>@zlingray It&#39;s more than &quot;words sound the same&quot;, though. That&#39;s why the linguists reject other crank family theories. It&#39;s very specific falsifiable laws, like Grimm&#39;s Law, that determine how the sounds in one language relate to those in another.</pre>

<pre>@zlingray The whole point is to look for falsifiable/verifiable such correspondences, and then test them. You can use these to actually predict what the word in one language should be in another, without knowing it ahead of time, and then go test the correctness of the theory.</pre>
