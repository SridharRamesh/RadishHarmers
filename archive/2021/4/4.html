<pre>I think it&#39;s difficult to be lonely, both romantically but also in a friendship sense, and the Internet offers the seeming promise of connection. But also it&#39;s easy to be stupid and not everyone is born charismatic or smooth, and it&#39;s such an artificial medium on top of that.</pre>
