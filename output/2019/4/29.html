Text: Yes, I'm aware that technically, LessWrong only refers to Yudkowsky's offshoot of the previously shared blog Overcoming Bias jointly run by Hanson and Yudkowsky. The relevant Hanson posts are at https://t.co/EzcjrMnv6r.

Text: @robinhanson It was just a coin flip, really, that Hemings was the one who agreed to be a slave while Jefferson agreed to be free. Slight change of mood and Jefferson would've been Hemings' slave. Weird coincidences in the racial statistics, but nothing extortionate or illegitimate I can see.

Text: @robinhanson There's clearly an implicature, if not an implication, in the way you juxtapose this discussion of Sally Hemings and her brother against "w/o extortion or other illegitimate pressures". I'd be a fool not to read here some myopia in what you take as constituting extortion etc.

Text: @robinhanson @negrosubversive Why do you think anyone would agree to be a chattel slave? What kind of "legitimate" pressures would ever lead to this?

Text: @robinhanson @negrosubversive And why was this "legitimate" pressure essentially exclusively experienced by African-Americans but not white Americans?

Text: @robinhanson @negrosubversive Not clear to you, certainly.

You brought up the word "extortion" earlier (with a suggestion that you consider extortion unethical but consider the enslavement of Sally Hemings and others like her plausibly free from extortion). What sort of situation counts as extortion to you?

Text: Sorry, this is too strong. I mean "The Libertarian Argument in Defense of State-Enforced Slavery as Not Always as Bad as Nuanceless Denouncers Think; Literally Underappreciated". I apologize for the rash caricature.

Text: Yes, the victims whose throats I slit were unhappy with such circumstances, with their unfortunate lot in life, but each ultimately agreed, as the best move given the situation, to die quickly (a mutually beneficial arrangement; I could fit so many more slashings into the day).
