Text: @BobAvakian @IHateNYT @lifterss @Carlyylra The Office has no particular greater ambition than to be a long-running sitcom. It succeeds at that ok. It didn't even launch with the ambition to devise a premise of its own.

Text: One of those "Why don't you just try acting?" moments, transposed to production. No room for a green screen in that $180 million budget? (Keep in mind, this is the same film where Henry Cavill's shirt magically grows a pocket between punches.) https://t.co/PF4Ku69xJM

Text: Jokes, selfies, food pics, all will lose validation efficacy. The next generation will move on; new mores will be forged, and I will adapt to those too. Regularly posting sex tapes for public feedback. "Only 6 Likes and 1 Share?!"

Text: @_julesh_ What? I mean, it's just words, but... Who doesn't consider the latter to be mathematics (and those who study such things to be mathematicians)? Are integers for mathematicians but natural numbers for informaticists?

Text: @shitshowdotinfo We learnt a lot about building construction from 9/11, and have applied it to all new and retrofitted buildings since. Perhaps more importantly, we've also engineered planes to be weaker, to prevent recurrence of tragedy, adapting "crumple zone" technology from modern cars.
