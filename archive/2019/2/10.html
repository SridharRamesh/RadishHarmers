It was fun and amiable.</pre>

<pre>Tuition is made up. It&#39;s all a scam. It doesn&#39;t nearly cost that much to run lectures and discussion sections; very little of that goes to the professors and TAs doing the teaching.

<pre>I mean, the ostensible teaching is also in many cases a sham, an empty credentialing ritual no actor in the process really cares about at more than a cargo cult level. And the scarcity model for college admissions is a con, and so on. Everything&#39;s designed grotesquely, a set-up.</pre>
