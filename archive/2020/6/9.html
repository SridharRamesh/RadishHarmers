<pre>@MacaesBruno India invented ideology, in the world&#39;s oldest language, Sanskrit (or Tamil, as it is known in the South). The very word &quot;ideology&quot; in English is etymologically derived from &quot;indeology&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@ajoeltaylor But, I mean, the whole joke is him recognizing his privilege. His clean water privilege is the opposite of unchecked! The whole joke is &quot;It&#39;s incredible how I get annoyed by minutiae, when stepping back, I ought be thankful I have necessities taken care of not everyone does&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@rahuldphys I think some have lost context. The one from February 2012 about being excited to beat his wife that night is, I believe, a play on the urban legend that the Super Bowl is the day when most wife beatings happen. He&#39;s pointing out that this myth makes no real sense.</pre>

<pre>This was a post from Super Bowl 2013, making the same sort of point Kaepernick would later be celebrated for making. Of course, years later, people forget what posts were made during what context, but still, you&#39;d have to be pretty dumb not to get this.</pre>

<pre>@themirrorin6x17 Context has been lost. The wife-beating one from February 2012 was from the night before the Super Bowl. I believe this may be a joke about the urban legend that more wife beating occurs on the day of the Super Bowl than any other day.</pre>

<pre>The first one here is the worst, but I&#39;m not sure the context. I have no idea if something was going around the the timeline he was making fun of or what. That&#39;s the difficulty with judging these 7.5 years later.

That last one is quite funny. https://t.co/fmUPBLh7C5</pre>

<pre>Since this is everyone&#39;s first response, fine, let&#39;s see the data. How much time does the average cop spend responding to &quot;there&#39;s a murderer in my house&quot; type emergency calls? How many murders-in-progress do they foil? https://t.co/2n4Y1GkMFt</pre>

<pre>@jackie_ess @JadeMasterMath Note also that with monoids, more than one quotient can have the same kernel in the sense of values mapped to zero (e.g., taking our monoid to be natural numbers under addition, both leaving it alone and identifying all values greater than, say, 7 have the same kernel).</pre>
