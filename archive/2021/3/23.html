<pre>With a freak occurrence of a weird thing showing up in your mass manufactured product which you did not actually eat or suffer from, it should have to happen to you at least twice in your life before you get to make a big deal out of it. One freak occurrence gets a mulligan.</pre>

<pre>I&#39;m not sure if I actually think this, because whatever, they&#39;re big corporations, go get that money, etc. I&#39;m not trying to be the corporate defender here.
