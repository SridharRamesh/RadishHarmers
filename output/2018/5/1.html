Text: @Sturgeons_Law Everyone gives in to Rajan Zed, too, because, not knowing any Hindus themselves, they assume this man is the Hindu-American pope. It's reminiscent of that period in the early 2000s when corporate America figured black people celebrate Kwanzaa in droves, their most sacred holiday.

Text: I graduated in May (it was my major and the subject of my dissertation), so I know all about May Day. It is the optional day of the year which may or may not be included, except on leap years, when it is mandatory. In the US, it is celebrated on the third Labour Day in September.

Text: @RKWinvisibleman @sarahoconnor_ I'm bound to disagree with you. Folks should be able to move and live where they want, and if they have to commit "fraud" to get around immoral laws, so be it. My heart doesn't constrain its sympathy to legalities, in a world where laws do not constrain themselves to moralities.

Text: @rogerbellin @faceplant10 @ebruenig Probably not worth my saying this, but: yeah, this phrasing is so old-fashioned and out of touch, and by nature of who he is, the guy is in fact a huge racist. But I don't actually find this term so offensively racist in itself. Is it so different from Englishman, Frenchman, etc?

Text: @rogerbellin @faceplant10 @ebruenig Of course, there's a history which taints the term, but really, the history taints anything white people say about Asian people, in some sense, no matter what words they use. The term itself isn't really the problem.
