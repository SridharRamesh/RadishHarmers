Text: I have learnt from the wisdom of the coin. Each head followed by a tail. Each tail followed by a head. One day online, one day off, in strict alternation, just as the coin flips.

Text: All the culturally celebrated figures in history were celebrated for their bucking of the system, and we join too in celebrating them. Back then, the system needed bucking. Now the system is good. Today, the right thing to do is keep your head down and go along with the system.

Text: It's funny to frame it this way, given how Kamala Harris doesn't pronounce her name following ethnic tradition, instead using an anglicization, even to the point of releasing pronunciation instruction videos using that anglicization. Her poor mother, her beautiful gift spurned. https://t.co/sinKxYS3cV

Text: The traditional pronunciation has all three vowels essentially as schwas, "kuh-muh-luh" (/kəmələ/). However, Kamala Harris uses, and instructs others to use, a much more open first vowel, "comma-luh" (/kamələ/). https://t.co/9c4vY1pwCR

Text: @GutStrings People write the final vowel as long, but I don't know, it often sounds to me like they don't pronounce it that way. I feel like the final vowel quality on names like this is much more debatable. But sure, I should've written it that way.

Text: @boy_gort I want to say the first and third syllables are stressed, I don't know that one is more stressed than the other, perhaps someone else can help me out on how to describe it. I feel like it rhymes with the start of "hullabaloo", presuming we all pronounce that similarly.

Text: Ok, the exact way of describing the last vowel I leave more up for grabs. Maybe I shouldn't call the last vowel exactly a schwa in either the traditional pronunciation or Kamala's. But the last vowel is not the one I mean to call attention to.

Text: @erasmusNYT Uh, what? No. The pronunciation I'm describing as traditional is, as one might expect, the traditional Indian pronunciation. There's a coincidentally similar Arabic name, but that has nothing to do with this one etymologically.
