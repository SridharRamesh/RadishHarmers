<pre>I was frustratingly poor at time management in high school, and I&#39;m still frustratingly poor at time management. I&#39;ve been putting off developing good time management skills for two decades.</pre>

<pre>@bferrigno I&#39;m incredibly good at procrastination. Game-changingly so. I&#39;m the Dick Fosbury of procrastination. https://t.co/8YdICMA7o5</pre>

<pre>My ears are burning. Is someone talking about me? Oh, and my gums are bleeding; I guess because I&#39;ve been talking about other people. Also, my skin and hair are shedding; not sure what&#39;s going on there.</pre>

<pre>A lot of folks seem to have the position that only people who always, without fail, have made the perfect and most calculatedly rational decisions deserve attention and redress for their misfortunes. What a poverty of imagination for the kind of better society we could construct.</pre>

<pre>I feel so guilty all the time, and I&#39;m not really sure why. It&#39;s not over any moral or ethical lapses; when I examine it, it&#39;s just over stuff like &quot;I should&#39;ve worked harder to make more money for my employer…&quot; or &quot;I should&#39;ve been better at accumulating awards and prestige…&quot;.</pre>

<pre>Mixing sincerity and gag, the thought itself and its reflexive deprecation, switching from one to the next and then back in the same thread.

A tonal mish-mash only penetrable to attempted exegesis with direct aid from the author. (And when he dies, so will this possibility.)</pre>

<pre>Everyone made such a big deal about object permanence when I was a young tot, so I boned up on the concept real strenuously. From when I exit till when I re-enter a room, I assume you all stand perfectly still. Sorry about that; when you get an itch, it must be awful.</pre>
