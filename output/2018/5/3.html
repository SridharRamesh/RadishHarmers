Text: Every time I fall ill, I forget what it feels like to be healthy. My memory for baseline qualia, those not discussed enough to even be given a name, isn't very strong.

Text: @victoriaxxviii Oh god. This old Redwall "MUCK", back in 1996. https://t.co/QkefMXQ79g.

Text: It also sucks (genuinely! It deserves empathy!) if a person has no friends, but for some reason, no one's itching to start the redistribution pilot there, working out the kinks in that less gendered territory. Somehow, it's obvious to all what a horrorshow that'd necessarily be.

Text: @jaubert_moniker I guess. I mean, sort of. I used to work for a similar Internet giant, and my personal level of access was greater than "none of it" but less than "all of it".

@manlorette, @Dan_bard, and @UpdogDemocrat, who I don't know but who are clearly all upstanding forward-thinkers.
