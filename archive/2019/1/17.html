<pre>Everyone&#39;s taking the bullshit quiz and, even while joking about it, still acting like the results are interesting and mean something. OCEAN is astrology for people who also are largely into astrology.</pre>

<pre>@jdegoes @shlevy Didn&#39;t folks spend 5 years debating whether a Monad is an Applicative? How about questions like as to the right instance of Monoid for Int, or whether Num ought be split into separate classes for +, -, and *? Type classes fall far short of accomplishing all you take them to here.</pre>

<pre>@jdegoes @shlevy My point is &quot;consideration of the Is-A relationship&quot; is only analogous to 1000 other design ?s type classes still leave you to deal with. I don&#39;t disagree that Is-A is oft a red herring question; I just think you&#39;re overhyping its significance, or type classes&#39; freedom from such.</pre>

<pre>The pattern continues up through 5,149,108,636, but then 5,149,108,637 is even and 5,149,108,638 odd. Mathematicians couldn&#39;t notice before because computing technology only recently made the calculations feasible. https://t.co/jCNWl6Wdu2</pre>
