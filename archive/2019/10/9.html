<pre>Next lesson: remembering to smile as though naturally into the mirror, in all its lonely artifice, like a fool. Is that what people do? I&#39;ll look it up before my 2020 selfie.</pre>

<pre>Just found out there was ANOTHER George Bush, and he was president first. Wow. They had mentioned it in school, and I voted for him in our second grade mock election, but I was distracted, dealing with my first glasses at the time.</pre>

<pre>@marx_knopfler It makes sense for people with power, like politicians (Bush is Bad). It makes less sense for people who are just entertainers or posters, not really responsible for anything (Jameela Jamil has annoying qualities but is not capital B Bad, particularly not for saying Bush is Bad.)</pre>

<pre>@marx_knopfler MLK cheating on his wife is not the sort of thing I mean as an evaluation of having and using power, but I will grant that it&#39;s more complicated than is easy to discuss in tweet size. This is one of those things where I genuinely feel the constraints of modern social media shape</pre>

<pre>@st4reintoabyss @marx_knopfler I think it&#39;s extremely silly that she wasn&#39;t aware before and I&#39;m all for making fun of that. I also think it&#39;s good that she sees it as monstrous now, and I encourage her in that. Basically, I think she should be made fun of but not, like, &quot;cancelled&quot; over this thing.</pre>

<pre>@wokeberia @AlKiran23 @Sturgeons_Law I actually did show Jared my before-and-after photos at the time, as I told him of how much he had inspired me. He got excited and called in his camera crew, who then had no choice but to keep rolling throughout. But these are no longer the most amusing part of the story now. https://t.co/VWZierxeFd</pre>
