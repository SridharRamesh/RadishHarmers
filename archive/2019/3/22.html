<pre>Everything feels disgusting when I&#39;m sick. Food, weather; even abstract concepts turn my stomach when sick. Parsimony? No thank you. Grimm&#39;s Law? Nauseating. A rectangle twice as wide as it is tall? UGH, could the world NOT, I&#39;m trying to get BETTER over here.</pre>

3. &quot;Shredder&quot;
2. &quot;King&quot;, by attractive women

<pre>I have six racist bones in my body, but they&#39;re those tiny ones in the ear. The smallest ones. I&#39;m basically non-racist. The rest of you guys, though, wow, the filth I hear coming out of your mouths.</pre>

<pre>Unpopular opinion: popular edition.

I don&#39;t like watching any movie or TV show about high school, because I was popular. My kind does not get a fair shake in Hollywood. Writers&#39; rooms forever villainize us for our crimes of being charismatic and friendly.</pre>

<pre>@pixelatedboat Huh. When I try to sign up for Instagram, it tells me my email address is already in use, but when I try to recover my password, it tells me it has no record of my account. Bizarre and frustrating. Anyway, from my prison cell, I wish you a happy birthday!</pre>
