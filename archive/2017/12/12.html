<pre>@marx_knopfler I didn&#39;t say anything about triangles. And to be clear, I don&#39;t mean the abstract topology. But the study of pos-def quadratic forms (Pythagorean/Euclidean/whatev norm) is definitely bolstered hugely in popularity by the fact that our spacetime makes such use of a quadratic form.</pre>

<pre>@marx_knopfler Same shit in what sense? Topologically?

<pre>@marx_knopfler Trigonometry is totally a study of circles; angles, rotations, etc. Which means it&#39;s not a study of triangles, as such. But, again, sure, inner product spaces would come up sometimes; just… less so. Kids wouldn&#39;t have to care about them so much.</pre>

<pre>@marx_knopfler Yes, I thought of mentioning this as well. Again, my point isn&#39;t that inner product spaces wouldn&#39;t come up at all; of course they&#39;ll come up in math, degree 2 forms are the next degree up from degree 1. But they&#39;d be more esoteric topics. Mathematicians would care; not everyone.</pre>

<pre>@marx_knopfler To me, the space of possibilities is very wide open; one can imagine all kinds of fictional stories, with all kinds of primitives; children could be primitive entities in themselves, governed by whatever rules, and not built up out of electrons with electron-rules and whatnot.</pre>

<pre>@marx_knopfler But that&#39;s the sticking point. For you, physics has to be very similar to current physics. Which of course will make it very similar to current physics…</pre>

<pre>@marx_knopfler It wouldn&#39;t be a &quot;relaxation modification of Newtonian physics that retains a lot of its present flavor&quot;, but it could well still be something interesting w/complex reproducing structures with complex interactions (whatever defining qualities of &quot;intelligent lifeforms&quot;). *shrugs*</pre>

<pre>@marx_knopfler @xayelet Obviously everything in the universe as it exists currently is based on the rules of physics of the universe as it exists currently. Of course sound waves and heat and whatever else would be different, or wouldn&#39;t even be concepts as such.</pre>
