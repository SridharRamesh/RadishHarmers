<pre>@jcreed Yup, that&#39;s it. In a regular category, we get the existence of epi-mono factorizations but not the uniqueness of epi-mono factorizations.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed Eg: Ring inclusion Z → Q (epi, mono, not iso) factors as epi then id, or id then mono. These aren&#39;t isomorphic as epi-mono factorizations.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed Any non-balanced regular category will do in the same way, of course (so, e.g., monoid inclusion N → Z works as a slightly simpler example).</pre>

<pre>@jcreed My compulsions are such that I must enumerate the simplest counterexamples to myself, in various senses of &quot;simplest&quot;. Indulge me as I note:</pre>

<pre>@jcreed Any meet semilattice is a regular category, and only balanced if trivial, so that even the &quot;walking arrow&quot; yields already a counterexample.</pre>

<pre>@JoeHeavner @sigfpe Haha, ah, its use is to pass it down to others, who shall in turn, in some small number, find use passing it down to others, ad infinitum.</pre>

<pre>@dsa_carter I concur. But I feel this way re: LOTS of things. Calculator-phobic curricula are a pointless hidebound frustration I could rant on for days</pre>

<pre>@JoeHeavner @sigfpe Calculationally, I don&#39;t see it doing anything Gauss. elim. (which is just intro algebra written differently) doesn&#39;t do more efficiently.</pre>

<pre>@JoeHeavner @sigfpe And while I&#39;d love to see standard math curricula overhauled to emphasize conceptual matters, I doubt that&#39;s how Cramer&#39;s rule is presented.</pre>

<pre>@JoeHeavner @sigfpe I suspect it is treated simply as voodoo formula to be rotely drilled on in some homework assignments and then forgotten (see poll results).</pre>

<pre>RT @RadishHarmers: Did you learn Cramer&#39;s rule in high school math?

No
Yes but don&#39;t remember it
Remember it but never had use for it
Yes…</pre>
