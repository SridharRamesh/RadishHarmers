Text: The danger cannot be mitigated by piecemeal efforts, a little progress here and there undone by relaxing our guard afterwards each time. If we are to defeat the coronavirus, we must assault it with raucous noise not only at 7 PM, but all throughout the day.

Text: @endlesswario It's an unfortunate setup. Even to say publicly the person one wishes to not have been cancelled (by virtue of wishing they hadn't done the thing they had been cancelled for, of course) still invites cancellation on the wisher. Too risky. You won't trip me up this way.
