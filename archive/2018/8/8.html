<pre>&quot;I&#39;m lying right now&quot;, jokes Pinocchio with sly grin. His nose grows and shrinks erratically, rapidly. Where its wood rubs against his face, sparks form; soon his whole frame is ablaze. &quot;Oh God! I should never have toyed with the forces of propositional logic!&quot;. His nose shrinks.</pre>

<pre>Major Internet services should be public utilities, and shouldn&#39;t get to ban anyone, any more than we expect the same of telephone or mail service. Like everything in a decent society, they should be universal programs. Convicted violent felons should have access to them.</pre>
