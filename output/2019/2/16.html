Text: @bridgietherease Twitter is the worst for discussing math at the length at which I'd like to discuss it, but:

Part 1:

As concerns every instance in which one is denoting an angle: Yes. Absolutely. It is much cleaner to write angles in terms of complete revolutions rather than half-revolutions.

Text: @bridgietherease I often (indeed, always, in my own head and personal notes) write angles in radians in terms of τ rather than π.

Though just as well, I often leave it out entirely, taking my angles in revolutions rather than radians; 1/4 for a quarter-turn rather than writing τ/4, etc.

Text: @bridgietherease But in those contexts where radians are called for, yes, I think in terms of conversion to full-revolutions (τ) rather than to half-revolutions (π).

Text: @bridgietherease This doesn't mean getting rid of π, as some histrionically take it; it just means adding a new concept to our at-hand vocabulary, in order to make it easiest to reason cleanly and directly about the things that matter, which is what mathematics in general is supposed to be about.

Text: @bridgietherease There is a whole web of related calculations in mathematics, such as:

1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... = π/4 = τ/8

1/1^2 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + 1/4^2 + ... = π^2/6 = τ^2/24

And for these, I would say, there is not some one canonical origin, from which all the other results flow; this web of connected results isn't all really about circumferences of circles, or volumes of circles in any sense.

Text: @bridgietherease People say φ sometimes instead of (1 + sqrt(5))/2, for the unique positive solution to φ^2 = φ + 1, and why not? What they care about when they say this is the latter property, not that it's equivalent to the former; that particular equivalence isn't always of any relevance.

Text: @bridgietherease Conclusion:

Anyway, these Part 2 and Part 3 long-winded spiels just concern the general web of related quantities in math that people think of as π-ish. There, it is false parsimony to always think of everything in terms of any one constant.

Text: @bridgietherease However, as far as angles measured in radians go, I repeat that, yes, π is a dumb way to look at everything, and τ (the conversion factor between radians and full revolutions, the two natural units in which to measure angles) is the right way to look at everything angular.
