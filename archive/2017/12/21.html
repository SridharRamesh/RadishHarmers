<pre>@jcreed @sigfpe I don&#39;t particularly like geometric algebra (in the thinking of everything via Clifford algebra sense), because I don&#39;t really see the point of thinking of everything this way.

<pre>@sigfpe @jcreed But I would say I often think of the physically geometric world as L tensor D, for some one-dimensional space L of lengths, that accounts for all that unit stuff, and then some &quot;unit-free&quot; 3d space D of directions and linear combinations of them.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed @sigfpe The one thing is that Clifford algebras come with the dot product turning grade 2 into grade 0 terms baked in, whose action inherently depends upon an arbitrary preferred unit of length.
