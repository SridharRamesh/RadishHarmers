<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@Scrotes3 @xerosome It totally can. You can go make this yourself right now, out of toilet paper or the like. The only thing weird about it is that it&#39;s knotted, in a sense, relative to a normal wall; put another way, you can&#39;t do it without some bottom of the wall passing over some top of the wall.</p></blockquote>

Neither of those are correct. You can go make this yourself right now out of a stretch of toilet paper or such. And you&#39;ll see it maintains two distinct sides. https://t.co/aV4TelELjm</p></blockquote>
