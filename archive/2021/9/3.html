<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have continued my journey as an apprentice of podcasting. I sought to learn more about being a podcast guest, but all 10 of my teachers were hosts. Listen to the first half if you want to hear about spooky math. Skip to the second half if that would be too frightening for you. https://t.co/J0yhuvCdCZ</p></blockquote>

But whether a reviewer would let it be a paper is up to them. https://t.co/HqomETZXm6</p></blockquote>
