<pre>For the record, @quasicoherence tried to save you, but in so doing, only invigorated me beyond hope of turning back. https://t.co/t05HYqEA2n</pre>

<pre>Oh, you&#39;re just the kind of cool spontaneous free spirit who would and has traveled to a foreign country on three hours notice? I don&#39;t care. Not my type. I wouldn&#39;t even go to the U.S. on 3 hours notice. It takes me 4 hours notice just to wake up in my apartment in the morning.</pre>

<pre>@rahuldphys @AEukaryote @bridgietherease This feels to me like you&#39;re muddying my purely beautiful math with some filthy empirical applications in mind (exponential growth isn&#39;t rare in math), but I&#39;m not terribly opinionated about a ratio vs. its reciprocal. I&#39;ll allow you your idiosyncrasies. But you&#39;re on thin ice...</pre>

<pre>@rahuldphys @AEukaryote @bridgietherease I&#39;m 100% here for noting that LaTeX is frustratingly inaptly designed in terms of matching natural ways of thinking about and writing math. In every little stupid way. https://t.co/BfKA1Xu8rw</pre>

<pre>@rahuldphys @AEukaryote @bridgietherease Oh, I&#39;m all for you thinking of e^{-1} as its own constant with its own name (ə, say) in the context of frequently reasoning about exponential decay. I do this too, anyway. I just think e is also worthy of some note, and in some sense more often of note at that.</pre>

<pre>@rahuldphys @AEukaryote @bridgietherease What I endorse is this: In all contexts, grant yourself the defns. that will make your life easiest to have at ready hand, thinking directly in terms of the concepts it would be best to think in terms of (carving your concerns at the joints), and not some other roundabout thing.</pre>
