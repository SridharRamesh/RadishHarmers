Text: It's weird having a particular celebrity everyone, strangers on trains and so on, is always comparing your looks to. You end up developing a sympathy for that celebrity and their work, beyond what you might otherwise disinterestedly have had.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law @christapeterso (I actually am curious to run some sort of analysis over the corpus of all my preserved writing, pre- and post- joining Twitter, and see if the frequency of "ought" usage relative to "should" shoots up right after that terrible decision.)

Text: Any idiot can follow any symbol-shuffling algorithm with the rules in front of them and weak time constraints, and most can be drilled to furthermore memorize such rules and carry them out quickly with low rate of error.

But why should they have to?

Text: @sigfpe Hm, I don't think it's necessary to drill kids on doing Kumon worksheets of 50 examples of decimal notation long division with the numbers changed, quickly and without flubs, for them to understand the concept of division, or other such things.

Text: @sigfpe And the fact that they are compelled to toil near-exclusively at such drudgery under the heading "math class" for years, I think, shifts the tenor of their understanding of and attitude toward math harmfully.

Text: @sigfpe So it's not about examples vs. abstractions, tho I have thoughts on that too, but rather, what are the skills/concepts we want to compulsorily instill, why are those particular ones important, do we effectively pull it off currently, and would other things be better uses of time?

Text: I used to find it so awfully boring how my parents insisted on watching the news those 30 minutes each night. Now I suck on the news dispenser dawn to dusk, no matter where I am or what I'm doing. At the dentist, on the toilet, any spot with a signal. I stay up late to jam it in.
