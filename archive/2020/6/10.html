He says &quot;We all agree Black Lives Matter, let&#39;s not infight&quot;, she chides him, then she demands payment. 30K people agree. Twitter is wild. https://t.co/WwuLCN3gWJ</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our requirements make longitudes vertical and latitudes horizontal. Since latitudes further from the Equator are shorter but have to be drawn with the same width (to keep longitudes drawn vertically), we must draw horizontal distance more stretched out further from the Equator.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(There&#39;s some subtlety about interpreting this at the poles. To let vertical longitudes cross at the poles, we should actually think of the Mercator map as on the sides of a cylinder, with the poles comprising top and bottom disks of the cylinder. But nevermind this subtlety.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Between all the RTs, this got millions of Likes, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true Mercator sought to inflate the area of Christendom. It&#39;s just the unique map where North is always straight up and angles in the vicinity of any point are accurately represented (useful for navigation). https://t.co/Op46hZAwrj</p></blockquote>

Twitter isn&#39;t the place for subtleties, and I really want to discuss spheres rather than the Earth anyway.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(It turns out the total vertical stretching is so bad, our cylinder actually grows infinitely tall, basically to accommodate the matching infinite horizontal stretching required to make tiny circles of latitude around the poles as wide as the Equator.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To keep angles accurate, we have to also stretch out vertical distance by the same factor near any point. And therefore area near that point gets stretched out by the square of that factor. The further from the Equator, the more the stretching.</p></blockquote>

The distance scale is the same in all directions at any point, but changes between latitudes precisely so as to make all latitudes the same width.</p></blockquote>
