Text: Canceling student debt is regressive. Doing nothing is regressive. Doing anything is regressive, in a regressive world. Well, there's one thing to do that isn't regressive, but the powers that be are deadset against doing it.

Text: @georgiamarxist @SamuelGWalters Well, sure, but lots of infinitely differentiable functions don't match the power series constructed in this way. Bump functions and such. Of course, this is informal, not meant to be rigorous as such, but bringing the word analytic into it seemed a little weird.

Text: @georgiamarxist @SamuelGWalters This is clever, I like it, but the gloss of what it shows is a bit weird, since I am accustomed to "analytic" being defined so it is nearly (not entirely, because of a local/global distinction, but nearly so) a plain tautology that an analytic function matches its power series.

Text: @georgiamarxist @SamuelGWalters I think it does show something different, though. What it shows it this: Suppose you have a function, and you define from it not just one Taylor series centered at one point, but all the Taylor series centered at each possible center. You can consider two converse things now:

Text: @georgiamarxist @SamuelGWalters Let T(x, a) be the evaluation x of the Taylor series for f centered at a. A naive term-wise differentiability calculation for d/da T(x, a) naively telescopes to 0. This tells us T(x, a) = T(x, x) = f(x). That's what this demonstrates.

What can go wrong?

Text: @georgiamarxist @SamuelGWalters With a standard bump function, it's clear that condition 2 fails, there is a jump discontinuity with respect to a. Can we get other conditions to be the failure point instead?

Text: @georgiamarxist @SamuelGWalters I shouldn't say it's weird to bring the word "analytic" into it at all, but it looks like this is a proof that all functions are analytic (in the sense of matching their Taylor series). But not all functions are analytic.

Text: @georgiamarxist @SamuelGWalters Well, then we can bring the word analytic in as a precondition and say we've proven all analytic functions are analytic. But that's clearly too trivial a summary of what we've demonstrated.

So I'm curious to figure out exactly what we've demonstrated leads to what.

Text: @georgiamarxist @SamuelGWalters What do you mean it falls apart? That's exactly what's being demonstrated, that T(x, a) should not depend on a at all. We want the sum of f^({n)}(a) (x - a)^n/n! to be f(x), which shouldn't depend on a at all. This is the point in the OP of finding the derivative to be zero.
