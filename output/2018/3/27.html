Text: I don't understand what makes the Heaviside calculus so famously considered "unrigorous". What's the problem with it in its own right (i.e., without explicit further grounding in the Laplace transform, etc)? What are the paradoxes one might be naively led to?

Text: @itsMycroft But looking at the method "Treat the differential operator as an algebraic entity obeying familiar algebraic properties (as we now understand how to do with linear operators in general)", I don't see what's lacking in justification.
