<pre>When one sense is lost, others grow more powerful to compensate. That one monkey can hear evil at a distance of 500 km, and the other sees it in both infrared and ultraviolet. The last one has excellent timing; &quot;the human metronome&quot;, they&#39;d call him, were circumstances different.</pre>

<pre>@jiveass_baloney In the 2-adic metric, each value does in fact have a unique representation as a binary value made up of 6s and 9s, stretching infinitely to the left.</pre>

<pre>@jiveass_baloney This may seem abstract, but is also closely related to standard computer representation of integers, as this is mod 2^n: With this wraparound-overflow, each n-bit value has a unique representation as the sum of d_i * 2^i over i &amp;lt; n for some choice of digits d_i drawn from {6, 9}.</pre>

<pre>@jiveass_baloney It&#39;s also worth noting that the set of values whose decimal-base representation consists only of the digits 6 and 9 is of great importance in mathematics, as the Cantor set. (Granted, it has other representations, but this one is near-paradigmatic)</pre>

<pre>@jiveass_baloney Suppose you have a 6,9-binary value X which agrees mod 2^n with a target value Y, and you want to extend it to agree mod 2^(n + 1) by adding either 6 * 2^n or 9 * 2^n. Well, precisely one such choice will work: 6 * 2^n if X and Y already agree mod 2^(n + 1) and 9 * 2^n otherwise.</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>@jiveass_baloney This works because 6 is even and 9 is odd (more abstractly, this works because 6 and 9&#39;s last bits in base 2 cover each possibility once, for the relevant bit of Y - X).

In this way, we inductively build up the unique 6,9-binary representation for any given Y.</pre>

<pre>@jiveass_baloney Another way to think of the 6,9-representation of X is by setting X = 3 * (W + 2 * N), where N is the binary value consisting of all 1s, and W is a 0,1-binary value to be determined. As N = -1, we get W = X/3 + 2.</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>@jiveass_baloney Thus, we get a &quot;finite&quot; representation terminating on the left in all 6s or all 9s precisely when X is divisible by 3 (the former when X &amp;gt;= -6, the latter when X &amp;lt; -6).</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>@jiveass_baloney Otherwise, the representation is trickier, but we can obtain W as X * (1/3) + 2 = X * (…010101010101010 + 1) + 2, and again, the pattern of 0s and 1s in W determines the patterns of 6s and 9s in X.</pre>
