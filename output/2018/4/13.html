Text: @collnsmith I Liked this tweet, but also recognize that I, too, match this description in part, or rather, careen harrowingly from gross narcissism to self-loathing, all broadcast publicly for some reason. So I have empathy for everyone else who is like that as well. It's the culture here.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby @portmanteauwar @realPodestrians I am going to push back on this getting peeved over "chai tea" thing and everyone will hate me. Luckily, you won't be there to counter-counter-argue. The game is rigged.

Text: Only a negligible percentage of my followers are folks who know me IRL, or know these guys, or even live in the Bay Area, but those of you who do, come see me off at the last live Podestrians; a chance to experience the latest franchise I've destroyed. https://t.co/97H7kO9XV8

Text: @leslieleeiii It seems like many people take him as at maximum sincerity so they can maximally dunk on him, which is of course the dumbest possible reading of the situation. https://t.co/v199pPhPRl

Text: Don't get annoyed by people over pointless, picayune shibboleths that you will never change. Accordingly, get annoyed by people getting annoyed by people over pointless, picayune shibboleths that you will never change. Don't grapple with the contradiction here; just do as I say.

Text: @twitersgoodboy I don't personally have any desire for it, but I want those who would enjoy it to have access to it. For these reasons, I voted yes, despite never eating mayo.
