Text: @_____JaYSoN____ No, I think it's cruel and awful (line 2). I also think you're a vile racist (line 1). AND I'm surprised by the nonchalant reaction. All 3.

Text: @_____JaYSoN____ Also bad: summary executions. As Black Lives Matter protests against. There can be more than one bad thing at a time.
