<pre>@sigfpe Did (1-e^(-∂))f = ∂L, where ∂L = log x, and derived Stirling&#39;s series. Amazing! I&#39;ll have to think more about what this tells us rigorously.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe Right; this approach can get you convergent Newton (or power?) series for the whole Hurwitz zeta function (or rather (s - 1)ζ(s, q)).</pre>
