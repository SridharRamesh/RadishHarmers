Text: @nibiru_TRUTH @TOS_Violator That's 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ..., and I'm happy to explain the sense in which it is -1/12 anytime. There is also a natural and fruitful sense in which 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ... = 1/2, even as it is also useful to observe that it doesn't converge and can be regrouped to various ends.

Text: @nibiru_TRUTH @TOS_Violator Concepts such as these do not come with one fixed definition handed down from the heavens on stone tablets. We can investigate a multiplicity of senses generalized from more familiar finitary addition, a web of family resemblances spun out in various ways to various purposes.

Text: @TOS_Violator @nibiru_TRUTH There is an obvious natural sense in which one may say that as well, though just as obvious is a sense in which it is 1. So far as putting the two of those together to interesting application goes, the Eilenberg-Mazur swindle is of particular note.

Text: @TOS_Violator @conor_tripler I appreciate their efforts to bring more mathematical awareness to the masses, or the mass of whatever group DM, but I hate this common gloss of Gabriel's horn.

Text: @TOS_Violator @conor_tripler Of course you could paint the outside with a finite volume of paint. Just use an ever-thinning layer of paint, the same way you fill the inside. It's stupid to say "You can fill it up with this much paint but not paint the surface with that same amount of paint".

Text: @TOS_Violator @conor_tripler It's true that we have a finite volume and an infinite area, but after some perhaps initial surprise, that shouldn't seem any great weirdness.

Text: @TOS_Violator @conor_tripler That's just like having a finite area and an infinite perimeter, which is very common. That's what you get from the bar graph illustrating any infinite convergent series.

Text: @TOS_Violator @conor_tripler A bar of height 1 next to a bar of height 1/2 next to a bar of height 1/4 next to one of height 1/8, etc, all of the same width, makes up an infinite width of bars, with finite total area 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... = 2. Or similarly for whatever other such series.

Text: @TOS_Violator @conor_tripler All these other things are stepped up in dimension, stepped up from discrete to continuous, the calculus to calculate their values is perhaps less familiar, and for that reason Gabriel's horn gets more oohs and awes rather than shrugs, but it's the exact same phenomenon.

Text: @TOS_Violator @conor_tripler These things shouldn't be constantly presented as weird, as math popularizers always do. The point of math is to defeat our confusions and achieve clear understanding, not to linger in our confusions and constantly re-present them still as confusions.

Text: @TOS_Violator @conor_tripler Anyway, I apologize for going on and on about some conversation in some group DM I'm not in. I dislike this common framing of this particular concept, I'm very curmudgeonly, but I still wish all the best to @neonwario in their general efforts.

Text: @neonwario @TOS_Violator @conor_tripler Yes. Filling it with paint gets paint on the entire surface. If you can do the former, you have done the latter.

Text: @nibiru_TRUTH @TOS_Violator For anyone who itches to know the sense in which 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ‚Ä¶ = -1/12, I've written on it years ago at https://t.co/SwYmJc8C5I. To be clear, there is also of course a very natural sense in which 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ‚Ä¶ is positively infinite.

Text: @zip_zod @nibiru_TRUTH @TOS_Violator For example:
ùü∑ - ùü∏ + ùüπ - ùü∫ + ùüª - ‚Ä¶
      ùü∑ - ùü∏ + ùüπ - ùü∫ + ùüª - ‚Ä¶

The second line is the first line shifted over one space. Go and add each value in the first line to whatever's below it in the second line, and you get a line that looks like:
ùü∑ - ùü∑ + ùü∑ - ùü∑ + ùü∑ - ‚Ä¶
