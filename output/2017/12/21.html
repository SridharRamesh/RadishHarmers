Text: @jcreed @sigfpe I don't particularly like geometric algebra (in the thinking of everything via Clifford algebra sense), because I don't really see the point of thinking of everything this way. That having been said, do you have this same TYPE ERROR feeling with, say, tensor algebras?

Text: @sigfpe @jcreed But I would say I often think of the physically geometric world as L tensor D, for some one-dimensional space L of lengths, that accounts for all that unit stuff, and then some "unit-free" 3d space D of directions and linear combinations of them.

Text: @jcreed @sigfpe The one thing is that Clifford algebras come with the dot product turning grade 2 into grade 0 terms baked in, whose action inherently depends upon an arbitrary preferred unit of length. That's the one ugly part, unless you factor out lengths from your vector space beforehand.

Instead of saying "It feels like applying a func : A -&gt; A to an element : A", I should've said "It feels like mapping application over a list", etc. But still not type error-ish, in feeling. It feels like just the canonical operation : [A -&gt; A] -&gt; A -&gt; [A].

Text: @jcreed @PLT_cheater @sigfpe I guess why should adding a scalar to a vector feel not fine at all? Well, because it's weird; it's not something there's normally any reason to do.
