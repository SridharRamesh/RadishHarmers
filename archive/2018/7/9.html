<pre>Elon Musk and his legions of Reply Guy and Gal hem-touchers, both (speaker and audience) on verge of fainting with pride at each new inanity, are the Worthington&#39;s Law sketch reabsorbed by reality at somewhat higher levels of parody.</pre>

<pre>Never forget that the entire reason you know of Elon Musk, the entire causal origin to his title as genius benevolent engineer and his unilaterally wielded power over global labor and resources, is that he happened to helm a credit card website you avoid using because it sucks.</pre>

<pre>How convenient that one day&#39;s work cracked both problems (floor wax AND dessert topping!). Frankly, it&#39;s shameful no one ever put that much thought toward either before. (Sure, we&#39;re not all Musks, but perhaps given a full week we could&#39;ve caught up to his weekend?) https://t.co/Lz0EbQNi28</pre>
