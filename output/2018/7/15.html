Text: I can't steal valour. I've tried, but it slips right off me. People take one look at me, in my impeccably recreated uniform with carefully researched medals, and after some time forcefully announce "You know what?... Not ALL troops deserve respect", before shuddering away.

Text: If you want a say in what the government decides, donate tens of thousands of dollars to the party in power (or both, to hedge your bets). 

If you want a say in what the government decides but don't have tens of thousands of dollars free to donate, agree with someone who does.

Text: @elektrotal And I'm speaking from the point of view of a practicing Nazi. Look at your own linked image in https://t.co/pfT5ghWv0t, and then do 2 seconds of Googling of a Nazi swastika, to see that both turn in the same direction.

Tilting and dots are common differences, but not direction.

Text: Elon Musk has heard the criticism, taken it to heart, and learnt from it.

He now knows the war on proficiency requires a stronger offensive. He will not again make the mistake of waiting so long to bring out the big guns. https://t.co/RK4E8usI4L

Text: @sodburger I've wanted to visit Thailand, but I haven't been able to get a straight answer from the consulate on whether I'd be permitted to skip the mandatory pedophilia or not; the rules for South Asians aren't as clear-cut as for Europeans. Fingers crossed they get it sorted out soon.

Text: I know there's a ton of repetitive Musk-dunking content on the TL right now (and always). But the one force for good in Twitter addiction is how it yields such explicit revelation of just how banally stupid all the lionized rich and powerful are. Today is amazing. Let us indulge.
