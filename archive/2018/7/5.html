The Truth, as always, somewhere in the middle: There is an elite cadre of 13 rapists, codenamed MS-13.</pre>

<pre>Yeah, yes, everything should just be free. Of course that&#39;s what I want; I refuse to feel otherwise. You can&#39;t pull that Jedi mind shit on me.</pre>

<pre>I had brunch this morning. I love brunch! Didn&#39;t have any mimosas, eggs, or yelling at waitstaff. I&#39;m not sure why Twitter has decided these are part of the definition of &quot;brunch&quot;, and thus gotten angry at brunch. I&#39;d replace dinner with brunch too. I&#39;d have one-a-day berliners.</pre>
