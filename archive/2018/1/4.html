<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence I always see some facet of the wording or another used to say &quot;That wasn&#39;t a REAL apology&quot;.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence Rather, the problem is that, no matter what, words can&#39;t dissipate anger at the original offense, and, as you noted, it takes a longer series of future events to demonstrate change and contrition. It&#39;s not possible to say any choice of words right away that will demonstrate this.</p></blockquote>
