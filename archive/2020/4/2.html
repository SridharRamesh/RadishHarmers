<pre>Even before it&#39;s over, the take will become that there is no need to change anything, no need for the systems in place to be better equipped, as a global pandemic is a freak event that won&#39;t recur. Business as usual usually works, hard cases make bad law, let&#39;s not rock the boat.</pre>
