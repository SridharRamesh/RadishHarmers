<pre>Using https://t.co/jr0k6yWs1k for a math blog is pretty annoying, in that all I want to do is take text files I have lying around with little LaTeX bits in them and toss them up on the web.

I&#39;m happy to manually convert $blah$ into $latex blah$, but further issues arise:</pre>

<pre>Is there any better option for math blogging? Again, all I want to do is take basically plain text files with a bit of LaTeX in them and toss them up on the web somewhere, where I can continue to edit them, with history stored in case I ever fuck up editing a post.</pre>

<pre>Only the Classic Visual editor is usable for this workflow. And who knows if at some point they&#39;ll kill off the Classic editor?

Plus, the built-in LaTeX support is so-so, equations display quite small, and other tolerable annoyances.</pre>

<pre>&amp;lt; and &amp;gt; symbols used in the Classic HTML editor will cause havoc, with bits of posts silently getting deleted, lost even to the editor. On the other hand, the Block editor inserts a bunch of crap if you want to pull things into an external text editor and back.</pre>

<pre>I&#39;ve been using WordPress dot com for my private math blog for a while now, archiving my thoughts for myself. It&#39;s mostly good, it has version history and almost everything I want. It just has these editor annoyances for writing math. I&#39;m just wondering if there&#39;s a better way.</pre>

<pre>@anthony__brice The workflow I want is where it&#39;s easy to edit things after uploading them, without having to manually run some command line operation and copy and paste the HTML for each tiny edit.</pre>

<pre>@anthony__brice So, something that directly hosts and lets me edit markdown + latex would be great.</pre>

<pre>@anthony__brice But if I have to manually store a local markdown + latex file, making sure it&#39;s always in sync with the website HTML, and then for each edit, edit my local markdown + latex file, and manually convert it into HTML and upload that to the website after each edit</pre>

<pre>I guess WordPress dot com already gives me most of what I want mostly good enough, on the backend. It&#39;s just that its editors are annoying and fuck things up. But using the Classic Visual editor is fine for now. Whatever. Computers are such a pain.</pre>

<pre>I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re white, black, brown, or purple: If you believe yourself capable of wielding the power of witchcraft, you are an idiot (and if it&#39;s a deeply defining matter of faith, then you are deeply definitively an idiot).

If you&#39;re green: No problem. Please, carry on.</pre>

<pre>Once people all got masks, they decided they could just congregate in large parties again, at least if my street is any indication. Some sort of birthday party going on, given the singing. I&#39;m the only dumb idiot who is denying himself the social outside fun everyone else enjoys.</pre>
