Text: If family or friends insist, I am willing to cook for them, with reluctance, with tears in my eyes, but I shall never, ever partake of the results myself. I am no fool. Right after eating a delicious meal is surely when I would be tastiest, to predators.

Text: @detachment_red Indeed, it needn't even be understood as intrinsically feigning. Is it so terrible to try to learn about new interests to share with someone you like and and feel closeness with? New interests can be interesting. (Alternatively, we could all just stay home and date ourselves.)

Text: @nathanhay @detachment_red Or I think, often, the way people on here talk about their love lives, it's like all just depersonalized sex with people they can't otherwise stand or at any rate do not actually like very much. It often seems quite odd and cold to me.
