Text: @dhk242 Everyone makes fun of the idea, as such things only attract weirdos, but it honestly is hard to find anyone swiping through dating apps who isn't a very basic liberal, in my experience. I love all my liberal friends, but I've come to want some more compatibility in such outlook.

Text: @dhk242 I don't really want a dating app for leftists, but it would be cool if dating apps let you search by any common interests at all anymore, instead of just random swiping through everyone nearby.

Text: My father reminisced to me about a toy I had when I was young, a toy car with a part that flipped up and shot a red ball that in turn opened up. One toy among dozens. I remember it well, but that my father remembers such details of some old toy of mine strikes me as very sweet.

Text: PEMDAS, my ass. Literally the only useful thing that PEMDAS/BODMAS/whatever conveys correctly is that, where there would otherwise be ambiguity, notational convention is for multiplication to take precedence over addition/subtraction. A more apt mnenonic would be My ASs.
