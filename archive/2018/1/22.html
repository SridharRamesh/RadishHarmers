<pre>Aw, you got me! You predicted aloud that I would do a thing in a situation, and then I came along and did just that very thing! Good job catching me out on, uh, having a consistent personality and not, er, choosing all actions via coin flips and die rolls.</pre>

<pre>Perhaps what I crave most about retirement is being able to enjoy Sundays again, or that portion of Sunday after mid-afternoon or so. A useless day, a faux-holiday, for I am cursed with the power of foresight.</pre>

<pre>Folks eat up that rollercoaster and bungee shit, but as a rule, I don&#39;t enjoy any activity where the alleged thrill is that your body yells the whole time &quot;WHOA THIS ISN&#39;T WHAT I WAS MADE FOR OH NO&quot;. I tend to be on the same page as my body. I tend to feel a kinship with my body.</pre>
