<pre>@Boringstein @shujaxhaider Second &quot;Peep Show&quot;, as hard as one can second an opinion.

(But then, I&#39;m also the only person in God&#39;s green earth who enjoyed and admired the fourth season of Arrested Development, so my tastes may not line up with yours. Luckily, Peep Show is nothing like Arrested Development)</pre>

<pre>@shujaxhaider @Boringstein Since you like Peep Show, you may enjoy other things those creators worked on, like The Thick of It (possibly the only good political sitcom of anytime recently; the proto-Veep if you want the Americanized version) and the movie Four Lions (it&#39;s great; a top five movie for me).</pre>

<pre>@Boringstein @dancrowley @shujaxhaider &quot;ambitious&quot; is exactly right. They knew stream-bingeing and rewatching, rather than weekly releases, would change the nature of the show they could make, and they took strong advantage of it, in a way that few other comedies had or still have yet attempted.</pre>

<pre>@shujaxhaider @Boringstein Yup, I agree that Veep is weaker than The Thick of It (Veep&#39;s early seasons were still enjoyable in their own way for me, but by now, it&#39;s utterly run out of steam and made bizarre cartoons of every character).</pre>
