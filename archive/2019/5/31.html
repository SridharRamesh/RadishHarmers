<pre>I scored in the 1100s on the SAT. Such a culturally biased test. Those 400 points you get for spelling your name right are harder for some of us than others.</pre>

<pre>The only things I want to do at this point are have a family, retire, and die. The milestones. Everything else feels like shameful procrastination. For that matter, it would be nice if my kids hurried up and gave me some grandchildren; I won&#39;t be around forever, you know.</pre>

<pre>Sometimes people say compliments to me and it&#39;s very nice; it&#39;s kind and feels great. But I feel like I rarely say compliments to others, even people I like. I should make myself say more compliments. I should allow myself to be sincere or even cornily so a couple times a month.</pre>

<pre>@Vada_Yakshi Aw... In fairness, I suspect the majority of STEM people have never thought about the things I&#39;m mentioning either. I&#39;m making a joke about a controversy over how grade school multiplication is taught, but part of the joke is that I&#39;m referencing more esoteric and advanced math.</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>@Vada_Yakshi The other part of the joke is that this controversy is framed as though kids are multiplying too slowly. But I&#39;m noting that nobody hand-multiplies in ways that&#39;re theoretically much more efficient, and there&#39;s no reason to drill any of this anyway; that&#39;s what computers are for.</pre>

I remember going to one Indian spelling bee thing as a child; very small scale, but it left me with one funny/striking memory about the competitiveness of the parents, but I&#39;ll tell the story some other time.</pre>
