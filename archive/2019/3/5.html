<pre>I&#39;d been callously insensitive for years, but having just attempted the challenge of swapping places for one day with my recovering alcoholic roommate, I must admit, my eyes were opened. I had no idea it was so difficult! I couldn&#39;t even get past the first of the Twelve Steps.</pre>

<pre>I&#39;m what would be called a self-hating Jew, were I Jewish. [Crowd begins murmuring]. I mean, because of my self-deprecation. [Struggling to be heard over the now quite large and raucous crowd]. No, it&#39;s like, &#39;cause I&#39;m always self-deprecating…</pre>

<pre>Like, just the other day, I made a careless silly mistake, and then exploded in shame, calling myself an idiot and a waste and a filthy little Shylock. I&#39;ve got charming self-deprecation in my bones.</pre>

<pre>Why are movies, literature, etc, that happen to feature many half-naked men always called &quot;homoerotic&quot;? Why not &quot;for-straight-women erotic&quot;? Can&#39;t I just be driving myself into financial ruin with my compulsive consumption of &quot;for-straight-women erotic&quot; art?</pre>

<pre>If you call yourself a socialist but also have a love life, you are discrediting the movement. Save that nonsense for after the revolution. There will be plenty of time to be young after the revolution.</pre>

<pre>&quot;Butt doctor... I AM—&quot;. Already, my words are drowned out by a wave of laughter from the audience; I needn&#39;t even finish the line. The very concept of a proctologist, it tickles them so. Another hit for me, the great Pagliacci! Yet somehow I feel so empty.</pre>
