Text: @tgdavies @ATabarrok @xkcd Wow, I swear I'd never even seen that, but it's almost identical. But I guess, once you have the idea, the elements fall into place accordingly.

Text: What is f(1) when f(x) = x/(1 - x)^2? Well, as 4f(x^2) - f(x) = f(-x), one might be inclined in some contexts to treat f(1) as f(-1)/3 = -1/12, and fruitfully so.

Text: CHICKS NIX DICK PIX.

(See https://t.co/CAtukDDQys. In general, wordplay of any sort is fraught territory for originality, and therefore best avoided, as the lowest-hanging fruit of ostensible wit…)

Text: e^20 = ...27197858457785818756568221.0

Proof: check ln(this) = 20 by calculating (this^ε - 1)/ε for ε ≈ 0; i.e., ε with many initial 0 digits, such as ε = 10000000.0.

Text: (Thus, e^100 = …27821900070921005101. Of course, more familiarly, e = 2.71828182846… Some coincidence that these all look so similar.)

Text: The calculation is easier if you start by just looking at a few digits at a time. For example, calculate ln(e^20)'s first N digits by plugging e^20's first N digits into (this^ε - 1)/ε for an ε whose first N digits are 0. The intermediate steps can be carried in mod 10^(2N) land.

Text: @wingsbynautilus Alas, you'll probably need to go beyond Alpha to see N ≥ 7. It's not computationally difficult at all, you can whip it up in your favorite programming environment and get an answer in a snap, or even do it by hand, but I can't get Alpha to agree to do it for me in linkable form.

Text: @haircut_hippie This is actually one of my favorite math jokes, one which leads to beautiful and fruitful mathematics; math as invented by joke, the way Wittgenstein spoke of a work of philosophy comprised of jokes. It's much better than the standard math joke about an "abelian grape".
