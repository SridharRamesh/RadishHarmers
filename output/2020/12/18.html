Text: This is dumb but so is everyone responding to it with "just ban the Nazis", like some well-defined unambiguous thing. Everyone crying out for this site to be constrained to their moderation is why this site keeps trying dumb things like this, flailing around to appease. https://t.co/UXZJBuFVPz

Text: Everyone on this site wants other people to not get to use this site or not get to write what they want on this site. Like if everyone with a phone was always crying over who else gets to talk to their friends on the phone.

Text: @RegrettableDec1 Why are you so worried about drooling morons? It's fine by me if drooling morons have access to the same things everyone has access to, telephone and mail and groceries and whatnot. Or should we just execute them?

Text: @RegrettableDec1 No one who self-labels as a Nazi is in the locus of power. You don't get into the locus of power by identifying with the universal buzzword for evil, the decades-old losing team. All the horrors of this world are now done by different powerful people.

Text: @RegrettableDec1 So then the proposal is, let's ban people who don't identify as Nazis, who aren't literal Hitler-idolizing Nazis, but who are immoral in some other sense deemed equivalent by the Twitter corporation. That's just not going to accomplish what anyone hopes for it to accomplish.

Text: @RegrettableDec1 As though "Let's ban the Nazis" would ever amount to "Let's ban senators and cops". And as though doing so would bring about the desired outcome of everyone thereby agreeing, yeah, let's not listen to senators or cops, they've got nothing going on. Like the tail can wag the dog.

Text: @RegrettableDec1 The best thing this site does is it makes it easy to see how fucking stupid all the lauded dummies are. Why actually grant the martyrhood of genuine censorship to all the people who already have victim complex whines?

Text: This is at the exact same time that Instagram slaps a "No, this is wrong, people who say these things are not to be listened to" sticker on you if you claim that Biden's 1994 tough-on-crime bill led to people being incarcerated. Yeah. Great. We need more of that.

Text: @AmyAlex63 @evboogie @TraceyUllman_ It is not unreasonable, and indeed very natural, for someone to use "The Simpsons" to refer to the TV show titled "The Simpsons".
