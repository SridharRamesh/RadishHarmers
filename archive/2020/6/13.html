<pre>@asmeurer Ah, yes, gotcha. But we have to presume then that #3 and #4 weren&#39;t seeded on the same side to begin with, even though clearly one was seeded on the same side as #1 and another on the same side as #2. That seems very difficult to be confident of arranging.</pre>

<pre>@asmeurer All of this is just for theoretical fun, mind you. I wouldn&#39;t actually say teams have objective consistently comparable rankings, etc. I just wanted to tweet some non-programming perspective on what sorting algorithms do.</pre>

<pre>There used to be no point being attracted to people on Twitter, because they all lived somewhere else. You were never going to meet up. Now it&#39;s the same even with dating apps in your city. Nothing to do but fuck your roommate, your pet, your roommate&#39;s pet, pet&#39;s roommate, etc.</pre>

<pre>Politically, old people have had all hope squeezed out of them. They&#39;ve narrowed and closed their aspirations through decades of Stockholm Syndrome. At least, this is the charitable interpretation.</pre>

<pre>@C_Trombley1 This discovery straight up made me do a 180 on who to tease. The original review was bombastic, I laughed at it too, but there&#39;s nothing I hate more than this &quot;You&#39;re not allowed to even talk about bad things unless I like you, or talk about talking, or…&quot; faux-outrage move.</pre>
