Text: @sclv Presuming you mean for the "iff" to bind less tightly than the other operators, this is the Yoneda embedding property for the partial order of propositions/truth values: a value is uniquely determined by the set of values which imply it (aka, are ≤ it).

Text: @sclv Ah, shit, right. I implicitly misread it to make a true statement. I don't see how to make a true statement out of what you actually meant. Is this meant to apply to ordinary Boolean propositions? What about when a = False, b = False, c = True, for example?

Text: @sclv The only Heyting algebra this holds in is the trivial one-element Heyting algebra, by considering that the left hand side of the iff always holds for a = False.

Text: @sclv Is your goal to detect which complete Heyting algebras are of the form "The ideals of L, under inclusion" for some bounded distributive lattice L?

Text: @sclv This is the concept of a coherent locale; one where compact elements are closed under finite meets and generate the whole algebra by arbitrary joins.

(But I may be misunderstanding your goal. I find it very difficult to talk math on Twitter with its length restrictions, actually

Text: @sclv The ideals of any poset give a distributive lattice? I don't think that's true, but maybe we're using differing terminology. Considering the non-distributive lattice M_3: 0 &lt; A, B, C &lt; 1, its ideals seem to me to form M_3 again.
