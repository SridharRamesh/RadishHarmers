<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I believe, on the usual convention for profunctor direction*, that Data.Profunctor.Ran (right Kan extension) and Data.Profunctor.Rift (right Kan lift) in Haskell are backwards; they should be swapped.<br><br>(*: The Star rather than Costar direction, in Data.Profunctor&#39;s terminology)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I suspect the source of confusion is that Procompose is reversed in argument order from Compose on Star, matching Compose on Costar instead (see https://t.co/OAg8qZ0dow), but that this was forgotten when Ran and Rift were written or named.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@sigfpe, you&#39;re cited in this documentation as a good resource on the matter (see https://t.co/Z37CGV1Dwc), at least on profunctor composition if not Kan extensions and lifts. You may be the one person here who can tell me if I&#39;m right or if I have it backwards myself.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The fact that all (pro)functors are taken to be endo(pro)functors on Hask, instead of more general, makes this sort of mistake harder to spot, since the otherwise immediately visible type distinction between spans and cospans gets lost.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@kmett @sigfpe Regardless of the order in which the covariant and contravariant arguments to a Profunctor are written, which argument is to correspond to the domain of the profunctor and which to the codomain of the profunctor, within the 2-category of profunctors?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ryanlcooper Jesus Christ. I guess to save disk space on the theory that stuff there is just temporary and you&#39;ll never be able to find and delete it yourself (since there&#39;s no easy way to navigate and manipulate the file and folder structure). What a horrid design we&#39;ve settled on.</p></blockquote>
