Text: Strong chance that by end of year, I'll have been on four different health insurance plans. In the meanwhile, I delay seeking treatment for things in the hopes I can avoid having to pay multiple deductibles. (This may end up foolish, but what comprises wisdom is hard to predict.)

Text: @MurrayOverboard Deleting the existing tweets of the people that got banned is particularly infuriating to me. There's so much history wrapped up in those things! Even those of us unbanned have so many conversations interleaved with those, now illegible! And favorite remembered tweets, and so on.

Text: [Or, depending on choice of illustration, 3 partially overlapping circles creating 8 regions (including the background), with 7 marked to indicate satisfaction of both propositions and the remaining one (where 2 circles meet outside the 3rd) not included among either proposition]

Text: The number of people banned is incredible. And still more every day. Fucking hell.

I'd be curious to see a list not just of who all was banned, but what their original offenses were in each case.

Text: Even as Twitter crumbles, I can't switch to Mastodon at this point. I'm too old, too set in my ways; an ancient creature who will ultimately disappear due to inability to adapt to my changing environment. Alas, there is no site for people like me.

Text: @ephemeralforms I 100% agree. I understand some of the mindset that motivated that design, but clearly, some schism between popular instances will eventually come, and then Mastodon will suffer the same kind of fate that's playing out here now.

Text: @ephemeralforms Yup, this is the other thing: even apart from schisms, there's nothing making Mastodon admins any less likely to ban your friends in the long run. It's got exactly the same design risks around that as Twitter, save for not being popular yet.
