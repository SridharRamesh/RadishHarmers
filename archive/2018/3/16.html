<pre>I&#39;m up to double-digit follower-losses in one day.

(On the rare occasions I&#39;ve pulled off the opposite, I&#39;ve felt like a God. This is all a burden for me to be aware of. Get me to the point where I can&#39;t see the least significant digits anymore.)</pre>

<pre>I’d get the fixation on π&#39;s digits if anyone had stuff to say about them, anything. But there’s only one thing to say (“They can&#39;t just cycle”), and that thing&#39;s better put in non-digit terms (“π&#39;s not x/y for whole x, y”), so the empty pop obsession with those digits frustrates.</pre>

<pre>Children are correct to be bored by recitations of memorized digits of π, and the like; to find it an uncompelling advertisement for mathematics. And those children who are into that stuff? They are incorrect.</pre>

<pre>(All my math tweets end up being about numbers and arithmetic, for natural but unfortunate reasons, perpetuating a rather narrow image of what math is. I wonder what the pithiest generally comprehensible thing about my actual field of logic that I could put in a tweet would be.)</pre>

<pre>Legacy is hard. Most die forgotten. But a few manage to pull it off, succeeding in having their names remembered for all time. Rare examples such as Charlemagne. Genghis Khan. Ozymandias.</pre>

<pre>&quot;Which one do I shoot? WHICH ONE DO I SHOOT?!&quot;, I ask in panic, gun in trembling hand going back and forth, as I am confronted by the malevolently cackling stranger looking just like me. Oh! Ask a question only I&#39;d know the answer to! Ah, I&#39;ll let him finish his monologue first…</pre>

<pre>@jaubert_moniker @cutasterfee @ErinGoudreau I think you did a fine job! You&#39;ve now inspired me to try to to come up with a math tweet for my limited math audience that plays on both &quot;taxicab numbers&quot; and &quot;taxicab geometry&quot;.</pre>
