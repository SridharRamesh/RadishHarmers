<pre>Surely, your honour, there must be something I can do to bolster my defence? Anything, to earn the mercy of the court‚Ä¶ ANYTHING.

[Cut to next morning. I stumble around searching for my trousers in an unfamiliar flat, all the while coughing up fibres from a powdered wig merkin.]</pre>

<pre>At last, after such careful planning, I break into the celebrity A-list, the Hollywood inner sanctum. I take a moment to steady myself on the bully pulpit, then launch my spree, cancelling stars left and right, before ultimately, as police close in, turning the cancel on myself.</pre>

<pre>@htmlmencken Jokes about prison rape are shitty and make light of a horrific trauma which no one deserves, not even those who have committed crimes of their own.

Murdering Nazis (friends, family, and acquaintances with terrible politics)? Hell yeah, that&#39;s the moral imperative good content!!</pre>

<pre>@rogerbellin @ByYourLogic @lushperson Hardly the first, though. There were various such moments before; e.g., a big Twitter flap last summer about AOC&#39;s waffly comments on Israel/Palestine (see https://t.co/j0uuU7SssB). No one really remembers it anymore, though (not even me, in detail); she&#39;d been doing well since.</pre>
