Text: @alexnpress FWIW, there's some debate by linguists as to what extent English has a "subjunctive form"; see https://t.co/49bsdFRDHl if you're interested.

Text: @alexnpress I know it's not the point of the anecdote, but some professional syntacticians would agree with younger you "We don't have that in English".

Text: @cosmohouck Well, you're coming to the wrong website. Go to Language Log! (There's plenty more there on subjunctives; I just picked one example post.)

Text: @Phonycian You guys… The whole thing is that she's saying "IM-PEACH", and he responds "I'm not peach. I'm vanilla". It's a child's joke. I'm serious.

Text: @Phonycian Maxine Waters, so goes the toon, is jealous of Trump's success (his two scoops, to her spilled one), and thus flailingly cries to IMPEACH.

Text: @Phonycian Trump then devastatingly puts her down with his nonchalant play on words. And then there's the overall play on words at the bottom.

Text: @blankeed @Phonycian It's not quite taking her as saying "I'm peach". She does pronounce "IMPEACH" the usual way. But then Trump only responds to the peach bit.

Text: @blankeed @Phonycian Not quite meaningfully, but in a sort of random word-association way, yes. It is a bad cartoon. Do not misinterpret my hermeneutics here.

Text: @CarlBeijer @Phonycian It's not "I'm peach"; it's just "impeach" pronounced the usual way, with Trump responding only to the peach part. Yeah, it's fucking stupid.
