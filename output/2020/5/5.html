Text: Everyone is interpreting this post as me shitting on these. That's not it. The only thing I'm trying to do is trick my followers into reading math.

Text: @kraccdown As it happens, I do the majority of my math in intuitionistic logic by default. I think it's meaningless to talk about it as the One True Logic, lots of rule systems are interesting to study, but it happens to be the logic relevant to many contexts in which I work.

Text: @kraccdown It is strictly more general than Boolean logic, more things are Heyting algebras (or, essentially the same, cartesian closed categories) than Boolean algebras, and thus "intuitionistic logic" applies in more contexts.

Text: @kraccdown That said, sometimes, one wants to make note of a specifically Boolean argument. So these are both worth having in one's mental toolbox. Just as sometimes one works with abelian groups and sometimes one works with non-abelian groups.

Text: @kraccdown I don't know what the article you read was, but it's worth noting that there are also logics relevant to quantum mechanics that go further in their departure from Boolean logic than intuitionistic logic; i.e., non-distributive "quantum logic" a la https://t.co/8miYaNDOq4.

Text: @kraccdown Intuitionistic logic isn't the stopping point. There is no stopping point. There are just a panoply of concepts one can think about, and a web of connections between them.

Text: @kraccdown But, for really talking well about what it means to reason within an alternative to "standard logic", and why this isn't actually wild, it's a perfectly normal thing anyone can get their head around, and why one would want to do it, and so on, I'd need more space than Twitter giv

Text: @ankyloren You are going to lose your mind when you find out about 12 = 3 * 4. And then put these next to each other.

Text: @ankyloren These sorts of things don't sing to me personally, they feel more like trivia than reusable insight, but to each their own. For what it's worth, these two instances in base ten are the only two instances of this pattern in any base.
