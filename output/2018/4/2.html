Text: For all the complaints… I actually haven't seen any April Fools' pranks/corporate jokes/whatever today. Not one. I'm sure some exist, but so unobtrusively as that it's completely escaped me.

Text: Columbus, you dolt! We were to go to India, for its wonderful spices (Black pepper! The mouth waters!). Instead, you've steered us way off, you dummy, you goddamn moron, you colossal historical blunderer. Nothing here, save these "chili"s. What're we gonna say when we get back?

Text: Well, you can go west at the next intersection, get on to the turnpike, go north through the tollgate at Augusta, till… Oh no.

Ah, you can keep right on this road. It changes now and… hm…
