<pre>Doctors are always trying to get you to do their job for them. It&#39;s your job to keep me healthy. Don&#39;t palm off the work of exercising on me.</pre>

<pre>&quot;My mother said to me, &#39;If you are a soldier, you will be a general. If you are a monk, you will be Pope&#39;. Instead, I was a painter, and became Picasso.&quot; â€”Picasso

That is so me. When I grow up, I don&#39;t want to be some general or pope. I burn with originality. I shall be Picasso.</pre>

<pre>I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re white, black, brown, or purple: If you believe yourself capable of wielding the power of witchcraft, you are an idiot.

If you&#39;re green: No problem. Please, carry on.</pre>

<pre>@dan_wickes Thank you. I&#39;m still committed to the project for which I was reducing my posting frequency, so I&#39;m not really back yet. Just one sporadic evening of indulgence.</pre>

<pre>When I quit drinking, I didn&#39;t do it all at once. I just drank less and less frequently, and eventually so rarely, it counted as never again, between each one-off occurrence of again.</pre>

<pre>@TheRutebega @ElDudrinoWeirdo You are taking it as a grammatical thing about &quot;Uber Eats driver&quot;. I did not have that thought but I see now it is the source of the confusion. I was only postulating that the boys ate her, in her role as a deliverer of food.</pre>

<pre>@niralshah I often see people on our corner of here taking it as a shibboleth associated with bad posts, as with an older fashion of Twitter jokes that dare to have multiple characters speaking in dialogue, but I sincerely think it&#39;s fine.</pre>

<pre>Spotting a poorly designed lottery with a million dollar payout but 0.0005% odds at $2 entry, the mathematician in me springs to action. I liquidate my assets to buy as many tickets as I can. For extra confidence, I buy each with my lucky number.</pre>
