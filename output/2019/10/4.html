Text: @yeetphilosopher The other great thing about dating apps that are actually dating apps is not having to navigate the ambiguity of interest; some initial romantic interest is a given from the get-go.

Text: @yeetphilosopher That all said, it's always weird to me so many dread learning dates have seen them on here. I'd kill for someone who clearly already has some idea of my personality and is into it (and vice versa), instead of my trying to connect with random Hufflepuff liberals or whatever.

Text: Those parables where someone says God's name just as they die, thereby accepting fealty to Him and thus going to Heaven no matter what else they did in life. That'll be me, halfway into shouting "Goddammit!" in violent scorn at my irksome children when the heart attack kicks in.

The time to reach N tickets remaining is a logarithmic function of N, in this case. That's as good a quantity to consider as any other.

The whole "sequences" vs "series" terminology distinction they teach in overformalized calc textbooks is silly, anyway. The words mean the same thing, really; it's up to you to decide what you're doing with a parade of values.

It's just a sum of something else (the sum from i = 1 to i = the initial number of tickets - N, of the time to sell the i-th ticket). Everything's a sum; it's just a matter of what one cares to look at.

Like I said, the one is just the converse of the other. I'm simply defending the person who wanted to say there was something logarithmic about this, for their joke.
