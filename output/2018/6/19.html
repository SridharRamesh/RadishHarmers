Text: @ModelOfTheory @TheMichaelBurge Of course, what people really mean isn't that the total of P(X = x and Time = t) over all x is preserved/invariant over all times t, but rather, that the total of P(X = x | Time = t) over all x is invariant (indeed, invariantly 1) over all times t, no?

Text: Gmail is now advising me on which emails to respond to, with counters of how many days it's been without my having sent a response yet. Thanks, but I can supply my own anxiety. (Hell, if you guys in Mountain View are running low, I have plenty to spare I'd be happy to gift you.)

Text: @mrkgrnao I'm on private, so you can't see me (unless someone else serves as intermediary), but, sure:

This is basically exactly like id : (s : Set) -&gt; Func(s, s), and however you normally think about that will work for this. [1/5]

Text: @mrkgrnao If you like, think of Funct(a, b) as having type Cat^{op} x Cat -&gt; Cat, where Cat is the category of categories (I'll ignore "size issues"). There is another map of the same type, which I'll call k1, which simply sends everything to the terminal category 1. [2/5]

Text: @mrkgrnao Your id : (c : Cat) -&gt; Func(c, c) can now be thought of as a dinatural transformation from k1 to Func. [3/5]

Text: @mrkgrnao If you want to ignore dinaturality and only think about more familiar ordinary natural transformations instead, you'll capture less of the functoriality, but you can do it. For that, replace the category Cat by its subcategory CatInv containing only its invertible morphisms.[4/5]

Text: @mrkgrnao Now we can think of Funct(c, c) as in fact of type CatInv -&gt; Cat, and can think of your id : (c : CatInv) -&gt; Func(c, c) as a global section of Func(c, c); that is, a natural transformation from the constantly 1 functor to Func(c, c). [5/5]

Text: @mrkgrnao All of this could be rephrased in terms of fibered categories instead of functors with codomain Cat, if you prefer that perspective. [6/5]

Text: @ModelOfTheory @TheMichaelBurge The unitary time evolution operator is the one which evolves/yields information about P(X = x | T = t). You shouldn't think of it as giving you any information whatsoever about P(T = t); the information it encodes and acts upon is entirely separate from that.

Text: @niralshah We should cease to have significant immigration enforcement, though... That in itself is already a vileness, even if one people have grown more comfortable with as status quo.

Text: @realDonaldTrump It's surprising to me that nobody seems to have so far put together that this is basically a copy-and-paste from a particular recent article's headline: https://t.co/0i2RePimRZ. He clearly read that and jumped off from there. Right wingers there thus buttress right wingers here.
