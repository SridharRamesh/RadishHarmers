Text: The contestants on Jeopardy! are idiots. They don't even know basic facts; "Who's George Washington?", "Where is Spain?", etc. These are our trivia champions? These are our venerated intellectuals?

Text: Black people are so harsh on themselves. I've had many positive experiences. I'd happily "go back"! If some bigots never would, it's their loss.

Text: Why is it such a selling point for The Phantom of the Opera, to be the longest-running musical on Broadway? 30 years? Man, that's too long. I can barely sit through a two hour musical.

Text: Look, officer, how many times do you need it explained? I was just following the rules. STOP, the sign demanded, so I relinquished control of my vehicle and ceased interfering with the situation. Frankly, there's a whole bunch of other folks you should be arresting here.

Text: Uber Pool added a passenger to my ride, and I was annoyed, but fair enough. Then it added another driver to my ride, and they argued the whole way about which route was best, but I get it, cost-savings. As they struggled for control of the wheel, it added another engine, with dis

Text: I despise orgasm, harbinger of the cessation of what had until then been ever-increasing pleasure. No thank you. Like Pavlov's dogs, I scowl at the thought of orgasm, or any stimulus associated with it.

Text: Mario games are good in proportion to the average number of exits from a level. SMB 1 through 3, good. Mario World, better. Mario 64, the best. Donkey Kong? Eh… Given this statistical pattern, I must theorize that the levels of Mario games are fundamentally displeasurable.

Text: What is interesting in math is often the process of getting from a simple concept which generates seemingly complicated behavior back down to a simple observation, by finding the right angle from which to view it.

Text: we wouldn't care that this simple result affixed to this simple concept if it wasn't surprising due to seeing the seemingly complicated chaos in the middle.

If it was obvious on first sight, if there was never any moment lost in the wilderness, it wouldn't have been interesting.

Text: All my anxiety jokes appeared to me in a dream, after many hours tranquil meditation in lotus pose. I sip on hot cocoa in my smoking jacket, then stroll leisurely to the laptop and post "I'll never stop fucking and sucking! If there's one fact you can count on, I fuck'n' suck!".

Text: As a child, there was such pressure to name my dad as my hero. What'd he ever do? Myriad nice things for me, more than anyone else ever did? That's not heroic; that's foolish. There were better kids in the world. His misplaced priorities must be considered neglectful; a deadbeat.
