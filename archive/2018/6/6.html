<pre>@collnsmith @creamsuit Indeed, on desktop this doesn&#39;t work, as I&#39;ve long noticed to my chagrin; you can only do it on the app. Twitter is so incoherently designed...</pre>

<pre>Oh, it&#39;s to be a dick measuring contest, is it? Shit, you may as well pack your stuff up and go home now; I&#39;ve won every dick measuring contest I&#39;ve ever been a part of. I&#39;m incredibly good at measuring dicks. My synthesis of accuracy and speed is nonpareil.</pre>

<pre>I used to eat whatever, yet stay unduly skinny. As I enter middle age, it&#39;ll flip; I will grow the belly traditional to my people. Ergo, by the IVT, there must be a moment of achieving Goldilocks perfection. I hope I&#39;m not stuck on a long phone call or in a work meeting that day.</pre>

<pre>The Twitter app forbids putting quotation marks into your bio. The website lets you do it, no complaint. If you&#39;ve done it via the website and then try to edit anything else via the app, it won&#39;t let you. This whole damn thing is made of yarn.</pre>

<pre>Advice is the Library of Babel. A panoply of differing opinions and in having to decide whose to put stock in, you are left back where you were before you sought out advice.</pre>
