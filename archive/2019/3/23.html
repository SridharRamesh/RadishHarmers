<pre>Actors love to play characters being really bad at acting, to make it look like acting is hard.

Bah! I&#39;ll be impressed by your acting skill when you show me you&#39;re capable of acting out acting markedly better than you can act. That&#39;s masterly acting.</pre>

<pre>I also tried several other keywords, such as &quot;fake&quot; and &quot;hoax&quot;, etc. This remains the earliest out of all the results I got even in that wider set, but let me know if you find other posts suggesting earlier skepticism. I am always curious about such things.</pre>

<pre>Meeting of Ashley Madison board, hammering out Terms of Service/User Agreement. Each time they come in the draft to a male pronoun used generically, someone points out that it should be &quot;he or she&quot; (or &quot;his or her&quot;, etc), and they all harrumph with pride at their inclusivity.</pre>
