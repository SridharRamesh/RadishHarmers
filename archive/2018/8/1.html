<pre>No, no, no! How can you be so obtuse? It was precisely in order to stave off any potential charges of Holocaust denialism that I arranged those ads in all the major papers in the first place, featuring my photo with the caption &quot;BIG BELIEVER IN HOLOCAUSTS&quot;.</pre>

<pre>The baby everyone thinks is markedly un-cute looks like a cute baby to me. It&#39;s an unusual angle and pose and captured mid-fright, but my powerful brain can accommodate for that and transpose to ordinary contexts (the same skills I used to crack the mystery of the colored dress).</pre>

<pre>For god&#39;s sake, just because you hear voices in your head doesn&#39;t mean you have to do what they say. &quot;Strangle this person&quot;, &quot;Strangle that person&quot;, yeah, yeah…; if the voices in your head jumped off a bridge, would you do it too? Grow some backbone.</pre>
