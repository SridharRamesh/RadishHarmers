Text: @jcreed @jpaykin If you just want to talk about convex hulls, maybe you don't need the A*B operator, as such? Rather, just a hull(A) closure operator? Could be easier to axiomatize the logic of.

Text: @jcreed @jpaykin I.e., currently you can create non-convex sets out of A * B, because A * B needn't be the convex hull of A v B when A or B aren't themselves convex. Perhaps that complication is unnecessary.

Text: @jcreed @jpaykin Right. On the other hand from what I was saying before, of course, A * B gives you more expressive power, so if there's a good way to approach it, great! But with the non-emptiness condition entering... it seems suddenly markedly less clean than it did.

Text: We talk about poverty as though being poor is a property of a person, a tragedy that has befallen them which we dearly wish we could better, but, alas, brute facts of the brute universe (as if they had cancer, or as if they were a bridge in disrepair, or something…).
