<pre>It&#39;s a little weird that it&#39;s always &quot;Bernie&quot; and never just &quot;Sanders&quot;. Is there a good explanation of this linguistic phenomenon?</pre>

<pre>Seems politicians are generally last-namers: &quot;Obama&quot;, &quot;Trump&quot;, etc. &quot;Hillary&quot; and &quot;Clinton&quot; both get play, former perhaps as disambiguator.</pre>

<pre>@TibiusReynolds I suppose it&#39;s also likely that Bernie paints himself as Bernie, to seem folksy or something.</pre>

<pre>@TibiusReynolds Still, an interesting anomaly. Some &quot;Barack&quot; conversations exist, but by far &quot;Obama&quot; is dominant, is my sense of things.</pre>
