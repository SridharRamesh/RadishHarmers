<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am trying to break into acting by being a seat-filler at the Academy Awards. Not for networking opportunities; god no,  I wouldn&#39;t bother anyone. Just for the experience, to develop the skill of sitting the right way, the way our finest actors would. Or convincingly seeming to.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If I were Newton inventing the laws of physics, I&#39;d have snuck in one where I have to be kept happy and healthy at all times.
