Text: @littmath That's right. F = MA in itself doesn't say anything. What makes it function is all the implicit knowledge of how much you get to presume has no effect in applying this law (a point sort of touched upon in the Wigner article, though I don't really care for that article).

Text: @littmath That is, what makes F = MA tick is to say "By the way, you should expect things to only experience 'force' when there's some reason you can point to for them to experience 'force'; the norm of the world is not to accelerate. And as for the few reasons that would make things

Text: @littmath Here also we must add presumptions that things generally maintain constant mass and acceleration is to be measured by such and such instruments and so on. Everything is contextual.

Text: @littmath Given that there's any such thing as a physical law, it's no surprise that one can then reason from these rules to their consequences. As for why there should be any such thing as a physical law, well, this is on par with why there should happen to be a physical world at all.

Text: @littmath I don't see such questions as being of the right category to have satisfying whys as answer. Yeah, one can conceive of things as having been different. In that sense it didn't have to be this way. What more can be said?
