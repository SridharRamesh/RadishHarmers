Text: @FrankieG_Baby https://t.co/xcPHCTkQbo. You can search Twitter to see the deranged things people are saying should happen to the people responsible for such a mild jibe. Luckily, none of it WILL happen, but as a pro-joke person, the attitude irks me.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby You can watch the video itself here: https://t.co/3BuehWIbOK. Keep in mind, they made a number of these videos for a number of politicians (also Donald Trump, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and Gary Cohn).

Text: @investmntwanker @wcthunderesq FWIW, I've found GCM rather ridiculous in general (e.g., unlike everyone else in these parts, I thought Fang trounced him in their debate); he's not my cup of tea. BUT, I am very pro- academics (and everyone) being able to freely voice their politics and still have job security.

Text: @investmntwanker @wcthunderesq So this was the focus of my question; job security for academics. Even "dweeby edgelord" professors, or whatever offense one may take him to have committed, oughtn't be drummed out of the academy over this sort of thing, and so that is what I was curious about.

Text: @investmntwanker @wcthunderesq Sure. To be clear, I have no knowledge of his academic work, and no judgement of it (and my main point here is he shouldn't have been made to leave his job). The things I found ridiculous (perhaps a better word is "silly") were just things like his Twitter, but that's irrelevant.

Text: Killed a tweet that would've def done numbers, because, on reflection, eh. The Daou poll is actually fine by me; let him ask and get some answers. He's a lunk in so many ways, and he def "presents white", but it's all made-up and his case is thorny and I'm not bothered he asked.

Text: At times, I can feel consciously my own opinions pulled in the direction that would do best numbers, and it is terrifying, for god knows how often, how near-constantly, this is happening in my mind sans warning. An inevitability, a fact of life, but I hate seeing my sausage made.

Text: And I say "do numbers", but this is as much of a phenomenon offline as it is online; it was present in academia, it is present in friendship, it is everywhere where it matters what other people think, which I have yet to find lacking in any interaction involving multiple people.

Text: Also, I used the word "opinions", but perhaps I should've said "beliefs". And who's to say my original opinions/beliefs were so great? Still, this doesn't seem the ideally soundest inference rule, or at least, it has worrisome aspects.
