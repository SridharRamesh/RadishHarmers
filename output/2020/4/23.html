Text: It's like they say. "Women cut off their left hand to get railed by Ryan from the OC, men cut off their right hand to get railed by Ryan from the OC". (I don't know how the convention became established, but the right hand is the gay one.) https://t.co/HvG5HNeWjl

Text: Sure, sure, shit on people fleeing high NYC rent, forced by circumstance to try anew to eke out a living in middle America, overwhelmed, resource-starved. Direct your anger at them for abdicated personal responsibility and not the landlord system itself. Very "leftist" of you.

Text: @whitebabyhands I know you love living in New York, where you live, but it's hardly a "plague" or "pandemic" to not be able to go to CBGB every night or whatever you're on about. Many as they age come to find themselves with other priorities, which take precedence over the drawbacks of NYC rent.
