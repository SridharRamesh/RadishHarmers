Text: Caught between two worlds, forged in the diaspora, I'm what they call a "coconut": brown on the outside, white on the inside, green and hairless on the actual outside, the outside outside, which no one knows about for some reason. On dating sites, I describe my figure as "husky".

Text: I don't think social media BigCorps (much less the government or whoever else) should be in the business of deciding what conspiracy theories aren't true and blocking discussion of them. I think people should be allowed to speculate wildly with their friends, I genuinely do.
