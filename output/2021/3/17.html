Text: @niralshah It sounds like you are describing the goal of the political project, but I mean specifically, what does the phrase "means of production" refer to here? It seems to me somewhat a weird outmoded phrasing to use in this context.

Text: @niralshah This is all why the "seize the means of production" language is weird. It feel inapt to me in this context versus more accurately describing what the issue is and what is to be done about it.

Text: @niralshah It's funny if the project only aspires to still have everyone forced to be a worker cranking out widgets all day, just also giving them a vote on the democratic board controlling their widget manufacturing decisions.

Text: @niralshah I think maybe I agree with the pithy quote "The hell of capitalism is the firm, not the fact that the firm has a boss", but I have to think more. And as for what implications that has, I don't know. Don't ask me. I'm just some guy, it doesn't matter that I have it all worked out.

Text: @frankieg_baby The second list seems more apropos, but it feels to me odd phrasing to talk or think about these power relations as "means of production". Like retrofitting into a factory model just for old phrase's sake.
