Text: @Glennfinito @a_medium_lord Huh. I'd just assumed it was short for, well, "refrigerator". History notwithstanding, I'm going to keep thinking of it that way.

Text: The folks who get to run the world are achingly dumb, even in your fave's admin. It's all a big club and you're not in it; from this flow the facts of what issues they care about. The one good thing about Twitter is logging these mindsets to public record. https://t.co/y2Wecbzhek
