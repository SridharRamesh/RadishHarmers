Text: @Sturgeons_Law This is very funny. But it seems like, on the sort of analysis that game theorists traditionally like to do, it would only be rational by this reasoning if you expect others to overestimate your wealth as high enough that it becomes more rational to just wear real chains.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law If everyone has full information, then the rational strategy (on a traditional analysis of rationality) can't be to do something with the expectation others will be fooled into thinking you wouldn't, since they have as much information as you about what you would rationally do.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law Could you expand on that? In what way would signaling power persist even after everyone knows the signal is easily and undetectably faked?

Text: @jamie_elizabeth @the_antifada Dear everyone: All I did was link to https://t.co/udfpBifdVw and joke I'd be starting my own podcast ("AM SR, your source for Sridhar in the morning, the hit you need to get through your workday"). I deleted it as it wasn't getting Likes. I jack off exclusively to classic novels.

Text: Why would I be a brain in a vat? Why would there be such a thing as brains? Of all the things to cling to empirical experience as having gotten right. There probably aren't even vats, come to think of it. There needn't be such a thing as in.

Text: @vlasicliberal In this inventiveness, comedy is antithetical to mere computation, as many are left thinking of math as amounting to, but points the way toward the essence of research math.

That said, most mathematicians aren't very good comedians. And in the reverse direction, even worse‚Ä¶
