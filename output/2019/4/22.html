Text: My teammates inform me we have to make a stronger marketing push. They are doubling down hard on contacting friends, lovers, and general well-wishers; anything to get the audience numbers up. Me, I am forced to do the only thing I can do: retweeting this every day until the show.

Text: RT @RadishHarmers: Heaven sounds like hell. Even after I die, I'm going to have to do more shit? I hope I end up in a permanent vegetative…

Text: @aketch20two It saddens me that the DVD commentary reveals they themselves didn't end up happy with that sketch. (Odenkirk seems overly worried about the fake gunshot on stage looking fakey, which seems a picayune matter to get hung up on.).

Text: @R850Mango No. I don't know if you're being serious, but a great many people seem to believe things like this in earnest, though it's not at all true. Change the 64 in Graham's number's definition to 100; change the 3s to 4s; none of this makes any difference to the ease of working with it.

Text: @R850Mango Martin Gardner once speculated Graham's Number was the largest number which had ever come up organically in a mathematical proof, that's all.

Text: @cbarrett I have an angry rant about the faith people put in Benford's Law (and the terrible arguments and "proofs" people put forth for it) but I'll save it for another time, and perhaps another medium (perhaps an opportunity to force myself to post on my moribund math blog).
