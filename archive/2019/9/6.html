<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I haven&#39;t looked into the details, but dating friends of friends seems at least as reasonable as dating random strangers you&#39;ve read one paragraph about in 10 seconds pre-swipe within a giant unfiltered stream lacking common interests, and that&#39;s the current main alternative, so.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@neoliberal_dad Yes, the main problem with the Facebook dating thing is remembering that neither I nor most people my age actually use Facebook anymore. And the ones who do? They are perhaps instantly marking themselves as not the same kind of person as me.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You have to support the villains; the underdogs. Batman gets everything he wants: luxurious wealth, incredible gadgets, a 24/7 servant, freedom from his overbearing parents, and that souped up car. Some guys get all the luck.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@WaywardWinifred @MorningConsult I don&#39;t doubt Bernie is crushing it with young voters, but the claim you made isn&#39;t quite what this chart shows. This chart isn&#39;t showing that the percentage of young voters who support Bernie is 20 points higher than the percentage of young voters who support the next candidate.</p></blockquote>
