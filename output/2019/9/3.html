Text: @disableist @trashage @viperwave The Poincaré conjecture has already been proven, in 2006. It was the ensuing freeing up of mental energy which in fact led to the flourishing of the early 2010s Internet.

Text: Offline is no bed of roses either. But I believe there may be a third -line out there, for science to discover; the paradise promised. I reach out, grasping for a better existence, and touch my hand to the third -line.

Text: @thejessicaraven I grant that one might worry about an analogy to how, for example, bosses oppose paying workers by disingenuously saying "Let's not taint our friendship with money talk…". But I stand by what I said, both this post and the ones that followed it.

Text: @thejessicaraven Granted, I don't have any friends, so I may misunderstand how it works. Perhaps it is true what Burns claimed in his 1989 dissertation contra Albright, that a man and a woman cannot be friends but only can engage in transactional relation.

Text: @primordialstew @thejessicaraven As @primordialstew was disappointed that I responded with a joke to an earnest post, I will say what I would've said in lieu of that joke were I speaking earnestly without character constraints, and then I will politely quit injecting myself into this conversation:

Text: @primordialstew @thejessicaraven My earnest position is that murder is unjust, I am not happy that women &amp; femmes are ever murdered by their male partners, it is horrifying, and paying money to friends for being friends will not put any dent in this injustice.

Text: @primordialstew @thejessicaraven More generally, even abstracted from this particular conversation, I have the disagreement about emotional labor discourse noted in my OP here.

Text: @primordialstew @thejessicaraven I still have disagreement with the "Pay your friends and loved ones for being your friends and loved ones" framing.

I thank you for the compliments you gave me and I apologize for nonetheless disagreeing on this particular matter. I now leave it there.
