Text: Between good ones, I often do hacky tweets of a sort I'd grumble at if I saw a comic do the same sort of "joke" in an actual show; trite shitty comedy. Flailing around on the flailsite, seeking attention. But I recognize my sins. I have the good taste to keep that stuff confined.

Text: @quasicoherence I agree. I was too skittish, too untrusting of the audience here.

Text: @quasicoherence What I really wanted to say was something like "Rather, with a devious grin, I lie and lie some more; first down, then about my breadth". But I did not play to the top of the audience's intelligence. I took them for the simpletons my competition trucks in.

Text: @quasicoherence I have corrected my failings. Maybe. The trouble with this site is no room to polish wording over time, no edit button or repeat performances; everything is one and done. (Well, one and done and endlessly RTed, in my case, but the numbers disaggregation disincentivizes reworking)

Text: Every night, I review myself, assigning both a presentation and a technical merit score, out of 6 points each. I stare at my numbers like a dieter at their scale. My therapist says this is rather unhealthy; she insists a unified ten point system would be more accurate and robust.

Text: About 4 million of the deaths of Jews in the Holocaust were tragic, but I think it's fair to say of the other 2 million (white men), eh, I'm over it.

Text: Feels like it was only yesterday that I was driving myself up the wall worrying what would become of me, instead of yesterday AND the day before AND two days before that AND 4–5 times a week for the 14 years before that AND likely continuing apace for the foreseeable future.

Text: @haircut_hippie @sheepcuties @ImpPoster I'm afraid I don't remember what other reference has pulled me into this thread, but perhaps it's because of the handle and my known fondnesses in this area. https://t.co/wLEWjicDJC
