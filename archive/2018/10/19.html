<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Philosophers have already considered every thought, every line of reasoning I reach Johnny-come-lately. Each position I hold seems monstrously ignorant to them; haven&#39;t I considered the counterargument of so-and-so&#39;s paper from when, and the wealth of literature in its wake?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking up is always hard, but extricating myself from this polycule one by one has been especially so. Each time I&#39;m on freedom&#39;s verge, someone objects I didn&#39;t say &quot;UNO&quot;, and I&#39;m back in again. Fucking and sucking and shaking my fist in rage, swearing I&#39;ll remember THIS time.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I waited till 1990, when You Can&#39;t Do That on Television went off air, to first say the words &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. I also avoided the names of any liquids. My parents were worried by my slow language development; an aide was arranged who slowly taught me &quot;water&quot;, Miracle Worker style.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The most blinkered consensus opinion on this site is that MadTV was good, a buried gem. The show with Stuart, Ms. Swan, etc? MadTV was a mix of tons of misses and tired gags and occasional hits just like SNL, whose reputation is buoyed only by not being literally actually SNL.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Each day, oscillating between highs and lows, optimism and pessimism, I have my moments of clarity, but no oracle to confirm for me which they were, no visible distinction from their opposites. I look back later and still don&#39;t know which moods to trust.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who would I describe as my influences? Oh, a variety of figures across various fields; mathematics, entertainment, political movements. I&#39;ll just name a few: Alan Turing, Ernest Hemingway, Abbie Hoffman, C. P. Ramanujam, Phil Ochs, Kurt GÃ¶del, Mark Rothko, and Hunter S. Thompson.</p></blockquote>
