<pre>All these arbitrary things happened to me; rolls of a die one way vs. another, and I&#39;ve had to carve out a self from them. It could just as well have been different, different experiences, different interests, hangups and obsessions, but now I cling to this identity like it&#39;s me.</pre>

<pre>I don&#39;t see why college ought have selective admission, anyway. Seems like false scarcity if you ask me. (Pitting Xs against Ys and yielding a million predictable simmering antagonisms, needlessly)</pre>

<pre>RT @RadishHarmers: Like a child with a diary, I write all my most private thoughts into my twitter. That way, no one will see them.</pre>

<pre>It&#39;s funny to see all the rich celebs enthralledly RTing some minor workplace flap (one coworker accidentally discarding another&#39;s lunch), as though they too work the kind of mind-numbingly tedious jobs where you pretend that stuff is intriguing high drama to get through the day.</pre>

<pre>What is the right balance between self-deprecating and &quot;fake it till you make it&quot;? (Is it panned all the way to one side? That&#39;d make things a lot easier.)</pre>
