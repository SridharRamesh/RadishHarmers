Text: How has no one done "The Hoarse_ebooks" yet? Well, perhaps it's for the best. Good luck deciphering this, archaeologists who have recovered this tweet and this tweet alone. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law Eh, the price seems appealing, but that level of savings isn't worth it. The last $2.50 Samsa I got had a huge insect in it.

Text: @ACLUOfficial In fairness, the twist is that he and the victim conspired so that she would commit suicide and he would frame himself for murder, but would not actually have committed murder. Still ridiculous, of course.
