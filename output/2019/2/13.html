Text: @redleaf8 I've been rewatching that whole series, start to finish, at the moment. Perhaps it got in my head. Great show, but I have to say... Whenever they show their monologue jokes, I'm unimpressed.

Text: @redleaf8 I watched and enjoyed that documentary as well, but was surprised and disappointed that they completely left out the major incident of Shandling crossing the picket lines during the Comedy Store strike. https://t.co/pKj7ydXs2I

Text: @redleaf8 They did leave in a lot of other stuff about Shandling's cruelties and flaws (e.g., his treatment of Linda Doucett). So, yeah; it's weird.

I mean, I'm guessing Apatow doesn't care about labor issues, but even then, it seems an important part of Shandling's rise at the Store.

Text: @rogerbellin For you personally? No, not a bad reason. But you personally weren't going to feed the world, and relying on billionaires personally to be suitably charitable was never going to work out to this effect either. The only path is a social restructuring to ignore the rich's riches.

Text: @rogerbellin I mean, I'm sure the guy who wrote it basically agrees with this. I'm just cranky, picking needless disagreements.

166 characters over the limit on a pointless "Look, you guys are misidentifying the CORE problem; listen to me!" post? Ugh, sorry. Time to stick to jokes again.

Text: @rogerbellin Yes, that's undoubtedly correct.

There's something in it that still feels weird to me, since part of how I feel is that the $130bn number is made-up even beyond capturing actual social relations. Like, Bezos effectively has the same wealth as Larry Ellison, mere $60 billionaire.

Text: @rogerbellin The theory in which Ellison can project only half as much power as Bezos seems to me somehow fantastically removed from the reality that they've both effectively maxed out their score, and neither will ever dip into levels where anything different happens between them.

Text: @rogerbellin Differentiating "World's richest" from "World's 10th richest" seems to me a kind of confusion of the way power-wealth works with the way real-goods-wealth works, and thus doing precise calculations on these numbers feels weird to me. They're both ∞aires.

Text: @ZachWeiner Usually, although this also presupposes having settled what the rules of inference (what can be derived from what) are. But people usually have the same rules of inference in mind (classical first-order logic, say, as opposed to intuitionistic logic or such things).

Text: @shlevy @argumatronic Yes, easily. Since 10 = 1 mod (10 - 1), we have that a number and the sum of its digits have the same value mod (10 - 1); thus, their difference is a multiple of (10 - 1). Thus, this process, which keeps reducing a number till it's one digit, can only terminate in 0 or (10 - 1).

Text: @shlevy @argumatronic However, the only way to get to 0 in one step is from a number which equals its digit-sum; this happens just for the numbers which are one-digit already.

Thus, starting from any number with more than one digit, this process ends in (10 - 1).
