Consider two primes the same if they both divide each other. Thus, 3 * 5 = (-3) * (-5) is no counterexample in the integers. And similarly for examples within the Eisenstein integers.

In this case? The explanation is simple enough but no one bothers to explain it. Students are expected to take this as a given without understanding it (or even appreciating there is something non-obvious here, that one might ask for explanation of).

My original question is in some sense equivalent to this question of why a fraction has a unique representation where the numerator and denominator have no common factors. Why can't a fraction have two different such representations?

Text: Why did it work out this way, though? Why couldn't it have been that 6/10 scales down to one thing, and 9/15 scales down to a different thing? Why is it that no matter what choices we make along the way, we always end at the same place, when scaling down a fraction?

Text: But neither of these was scaled down as far as possible. 9/15 can still be scaled down further, to 3/5, which can't be scaled down anymore. 6/10 can also be scaled down to 3/5. No matter what starting choice we made, if we keep going, we end up at 3/5.

Text: Consider a fraction like 36/60. We can scale this fraction down, because 36 and 60 are both divisible by 4. Scaling numerator and denominator down by 4, we get 9/15. We can also scale 36/60 down using that 36 and 60 are both divisible by 6. Scaling down by 6, 36/60 becomes 6/10.

Text: @postergenocide Why should it have to be that any two different ways of getting the same result involve stealing a factor from one thing to give to another? That's not an obvious fact. That's just as demanding of explanation. Indeed, that's basically what I'm asking for an explanation for.

Text: @postergenocide You'd probably object "There really are 3s and 7s in there, you're just disallowing those". Fair, fair.

But in the same way, someone might say, nothing is truly prime, it only seems that way by ignoring something. 5 isn't prime, because 5 is 2.5 x 2. 5 is π x 1.59154943092….

It'll eventually get to the (36, 60) we constructed this line to go through, and thus (36, 60) itself is a multiple of (3, 5). Every grid point on the line is a multiple of the smallest one.

If you multiply together a bunch of primes that aren't P, then the result won't be divisible by P. The only way to get a result divisible by P is for one of the primes to be P, by what we just showed.
