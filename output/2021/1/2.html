Text: @mcbyrne @CarlBeijer No one ever used to say "Fuck X" to express displeasure with politicians. It is a horrifying new development in our culture and I am frightened to see where it may lead.

Text: Just heard a CNN commentator tut-tutting "Don't protest politicians with graffiti. Vote!". We just did that. We just did that and it didn't work and the winners haven't even taken their seat yet. It's the worst possible time for that argument and still it's used so smugly.

Text: Bayesianism is misguided, but all the same, this linguistic move is perfectly natural. They've updated their priors to become their posteriors. This is like saying you can't marry your fianc√©(e) because once you marry them they're not your fianc√©(e) anymore. https://t.co/oFFbLxmVT1

Text: @tequehead There's no particular reason that all or most uncertainty should be analyzed via the mathematics of proportion, or reasonably quantifiable or comparable at all (as in, Knightian uncertainty).

Text: @tequehead There is no number hidden in my head for what I think about whether the winner of the Super Bowl in the year 2500 will be a team named after an animal or not, nor is there any reason I should have such a number hidden in my head.

Text: @tequehead Mind you, the frequentists tend to be misguided in their own ways, with their urged conflations of the meaning of a conditional probability with its converse, qua p-value significance testing.

Text: @tequehead Everyone wants so badly to know the things we don't know, that they pretend we can just do something else and thus know it, by power of math, so long as numbers and calculations are around.
