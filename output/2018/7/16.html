Text: The "Couple of things…" thread that went viral recently on Hindu vs. Nazi swastikas had a couple informative points for those unfamiliar with Hindu iconography, but also some outright falsehoods. Most of all, this immediately debunkable urban legend that yet refuses to die.

Text: On the left, Hindu swastikas from the very example illustration given in that very thread! On the right, the personal standard of Hitler. Both un-tilted, both dot-less, and, contra what you've repeated your whole life but never checked, both turning in the same exact direction. https://t.co/dVdvC2fSGq

Text: Nazi swastikas are usually tilted 45°, and Hindu swastikas usually aren't, but neither is always true. Hindu ones often have 4 dots, but frequently enough just as well don't. And while both orientations are used throughout Asia and its various religions, I cannot repeat enough:

Text: The actual distinction is that Hindu swastikas are used in conveying Hindu messages, while Nazi swastikas are used in conveying Nazi messages. If you want to know which you're dealing with, look at the use; don't look at some other thing. This is how everything works.

Text: The brute empirical fact is that this symbol is both a Hindu swastika and a Nazi swastika. There needn't be any marking in the symbol itself to distinguish Hindu from Nazi use; such is magical thinking. I'm not saying this because I want it to be so, but as brute empirical fact.

Text: @royaltheartist Let me understand you correctly. Are you saying that you normally rhyme the word "nice" in "Have a nice day" with a word like, say, "Greece"? Do "Have a nice day" and "Have a Greece day" rhyme for you?

Text: @royaltheartist I have never heard of such a thing. Like @AllenVentano, I no longer know what is going on here and fear involving myself with a bit which can only result in my downfall.

Text: @royaltheartist @AllenVentano On the marginal off-chance that you're serious, no, I pronounce "nice" like "ice". For me, "Have a nice day" is pronounced almost exactly the same as "Have an ice day".

(There's a SLIGHT difference between these two for me, but not one relevant to the words "nice" and "ice").

Text: I no longer see "grifter" as some great insult. Whatever; do what it takes to make money in this world. That's what the world demands, right? Making money? Part some well-off fools from their own, and you're just doing what every facet of society has trained you to. No anomaly.

Text: Opening a series of adjacent restaurants with widely varying sanitation standards in order to get the municipal government to spell out "ACAB" in the windows. 

Alas, the restaurant business is much tougher than I realize. I only make it to "ACC" (Cathy voice), then go bankrupt.

Text: Judging by my number of recent mopish complain-tweets (an indulgence best kept rare), plus the diminished fun from being on private mode anyway, it's time for another Twitter break.

See you in August. DMs remain open always.
