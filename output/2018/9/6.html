Text: Many of my posts were intended be New Yorker cartoons, but I never learnt to draw, or where to submit New Yorker cartoons. (What's that mnemonic again? I believe it was something like "Write to me, 'Stace Tilley, P.O. Box 963; New York City, New York State, 10108…")

Text: Bit odd, the part in the op-ed where, as the antagonism towards Trump gets particularly heated, a second anonymous writer suddenly interjects to write "WorldStar!!". Any ideas as to what this clue could mean?
