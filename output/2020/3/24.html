Text: Folks say "In exponential growth, the time to go from 100 cases to 1,000 is the same as from 1,000 to 10,000, and so on", then start drawing graphs of bell curves to flatten. Bell curves don't have that property in the first place. It doesn't matter, it's pedantic, but yeah.

Text: Toy Story was filmed using a large green screen and actors clothed entirely in matching green, with visuals added in post. In the sequels, this was streamlined to use only the green screen, an innovation now known as "the Lasseter process" and abandoned in tarnished association.
