<pre>Look, I&#39;m not one of those freewheeling hedonist libertines who enjoys their life. Pleasure? Happiness? Those are alright for some people, I guess, if you&#39;re into that sort of thing, but they&#39;re just not my cup of tea. Me, I&#39;m more of an experience-the-passage-of-time person.</pre>

<pre>Just to let you guys know, none of this shit is real. I died in 1989. This is all just some Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, end of Brazil, etc type sitch. Let your stresses melt away, relieved to learn both they and you yourself are but a hallucinatory flicker in my mortal mind.</pre>
