<pre>The best and most interesting comedy is where everyone makes wise and weighty speeches all the time, directly expressing truths from author to viewer, so long as every now and then there&#39;s a snarkily sarcastic sentence . Do not apply this post to itself.</pre>

<pre>Most of your friends are women or gay dudes. You like astrology. Most of your friends like astrology. You are an astrologer&#39;s client. You experienced events in 2010, and your life is very different now from ten years ago. You will lose your right leg in a car crash on August 8th. https://t.co/mI83QmGuw0</pre>

<pre>I hate this frequent take. The Fight Club guy was disenchanted with his white collar cog job maximizing car company profits by calculating the laxest safety standards they could get away with. If no one ought be unfulfilled with that and aspire to more, we&#39;re all fucked. https://t.co/eu0rnUD5DI</pre>
