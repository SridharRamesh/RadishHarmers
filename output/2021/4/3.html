Text: @capet_louis Picking the seeds is such a pain. But I've discovered a store near me stocks containers of pre-picked fresh pomegranate seeds. I know it's perhaps bougie to pay for such a thing instead of just picking them myself, but it is divine. And so I must deny myself its pleasure.

Text: I am sympathetic to stupidity, as I've been stupid myself. Stupidity is precisely the sort of failing that simply aspiring not to be does not save oneself from. I am in fact overly sympathetic to stupidity, as I am stupid.

Text: I once accidentally typed "Ali Farrakhan" in a tweet instead of "Louis Farrakhan", because my dumb brain was pulling up Ali Farahnakian. I quickly deleted and fixed it, but even now, I am constantly worried about those who saw it and have been judging my stupidity. Forgive me.

Text: Low-hanging fruit. Several predecessors can be found, on top of which the only real innovation is fitting to a template (which in itself is the definition of formula). I used to have integrity about avoiding doing anything so obvious. Well, have fun with it.

Text: Neil Armstrong made constant fun of Buzz Aldrin's looks. "Your nose is so big, I can see it from outer space", he jibed throughout their approach to the moon. To ameliorate the situation, NASA was forced to design spacesuits whose visors completely obscure astronauts' faces.
