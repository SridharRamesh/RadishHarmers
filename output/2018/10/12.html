Text: "Say it ain't so, Joe!", cried the boy. He wept to see "Shoeless" Joe Jackson wearing shoes.

"Me babe, steppin' out. Into the night. Into the light", explained Joe. "I stepped into, into another, into another world. There was no light. Michael Jackson is my son". Harder weeping.

Text: Spoonerizing "pleonasmic encomium" into "neoplasmic meconium", I deliver the sickest burn in Oxford Union history. Open weeping can be heard. After two storied centuries, the society shutters its doors forever, a bittersweet note lamenting "There are no worlds left to conquerâ€¦".

Text: For each of my responsibilities and long-term goals, I would like one year with nothing else I have to do but taking care of that one. I'll get this whole thing solidly licked in under a decade.

Text: Fine, I'm going to go two weeks without self-retweeting. Perhaps it will force me to come up with new gold, perhaps it will send me to my grave. (I will still self-quote as opportunity permits.)

Text: Judge me not by my follower count. Judge me by my coefficient in the limiting eigenvector distribution of the stochastic matrix representing the follower-followee relation (my PageRank, as it were).

Text: Why is the 1918 thing going around again? It's from February. I already responded to it back then; I'm not playing this game again. I refuse to have excess fun.
