<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just heard a CNN commentator tut-tutting &quot;Don&#39;t protest politicians with graffiti. Vote!&quot;. We just did that. We just did that and it didn&#39;t work and the winners haven&#39;t even taken their seat yet. It&#39;s the worst possible time for that argument and still it&#39;s used so smugly.</p></blockquote>
