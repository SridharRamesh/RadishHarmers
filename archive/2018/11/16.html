<pre>@wcthunderesq @martsendo &quot;When someone tells you they have reservations about Antifa, pay attention. They&#39;re telling you they literally support fascism&quot;, remark an awful lot more posters than I believe support the pro-life movement.</pre>

<pre>Just to save anyone else from making the same mistake I did: Do NOT take weatherwear advice from apocryphal Mark Twain. The man was a moron! New York winters are way colder than San Francisco summers (it&#39;s not even close!).</pre>

<pre>I voice my sharpest insights and most hilarious jokes skipping fundamental frequencies altogether, eloquently using overtones alone. Pay no attention to the children claiming otherwise; they&#39;re early growers or something, they&#39;re all fucked up.</pre>

<pre>Because some people on Reddit are annoying, God totally exists, and powerful evidence for the efficacy of astrology is found in how many dudes buy into laissez-faire economics. All ideas are joined in a great web of balance scales, and if one is dumb, the rest are then anti-dumb.</pre>
