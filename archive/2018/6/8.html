<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hm, on re-read, I&#39;m not sure I effectively and understandably said what I wanted to say here after the needed surgery to cut it down to 280, but maybe some of the gist got through anyway.<br><br>(Bump us up to 560. And then beyond. I will never be happy with any character constraints.)</p></blockquote>

Indeed, there wasn&#39;t even a Wikipedia page about him until 2010; see https://t.co/FqhXBT8QwY.</p></blockquote>
