Text: @sqrtnegative1 Although I actually mean, it's hard to convey "Why is this game of interest to lots of mathematicians and not that one?", …

Text: @sqrtnegative1 E.g., why care about primes, or rings, or graphs…? Well, they are well-situated, connection-wise, in the math landscape.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 Why not care so much about, say, operations satisfying (x * y) * (x * z) = z * (y * x), or the theory of chess endgames?

Text: @sqrtnegative1 You could, and some do, but not as well-situated. Doesn't illuminate quickly much else in the web of math to date.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 But just conveying definitions to lay ppl is actually oft not that hard (even for "advanced" topics), if no need to motivate!

Text: @sqrtnegative1 Anyway, this is the thing I keep forgetting when "What do you study?" arises. Defns easy enough, but motivation really hard.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 Tl;dr: clearly, any bit of math had some point to the folks who studied it, and that's often the part that's hard to convey.

Text: @CarlBeijer Huh. I feel like in our circles, ppl use "left" to mean socialist as opposed to liberal. But yes, always potential for confusion

Text: @CarlBeijer Also confusing: many in mainstream using "liberal" to mean any of these; socialism as "extreme liberals" etc. Language is tricky
