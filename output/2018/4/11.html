Text: @mattcasey It's FOMO. Like, "Maybe someone's announcing a really cool party or a long-secret crush on me or…!". Teen nonsense.

Actually, I suppose the big thing is, I use FB Messenger a lot, so I end up going to the site for that. Though I know there's another site that's Messenger only.

Text: @lorismentality I saw you note this happening once before in another incident, but never knew the details. But you're right (of course you're right!). It's a pretty basic and easy rule to not show people your dick against their lack of consent, not even to own them for bad politics or whatever.

And you're also right that folks here (&amp; elsewhere) turn a blind eye to so much via a mindset of everything as just teams.

And, well, you're right about everything. As of course you are.

Text: @sigfpe I suppose the more general lesson is not just about matrices, but about polynomials: a high-degree equation's solutions may change significantly even with teeny weeny coefficient changes. As in shifting the equation "x^40 = 0" to "x^40 = 10^(-20)".
