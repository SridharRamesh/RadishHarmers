<pre>I haven&#39;t even seen whatever this &quot;Norm MacDonald likes Jordan Peterson&quot; thing is that everyone is talking about, but, yes, if you&#39;ve been paying any attention, this sort of thing shouldn&#39;t surprise you. I stand by everything I said in this thread.</pre>

<pre>Oh fuck. I&#39;ve become the angry old man who&#39;s annoyed that the children who moved in next door make too much noise.
