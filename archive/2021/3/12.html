<pre>Lactose intolerance is the default state of human adults, exceptional only among a few populations such as Europeans. But instead of looking at things this way, we instead label it undesirable for people of color to fart and burp a lot.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed Huh, that&#39;s surprising to me. Doesn&#39;t a suitably trivial reflexive (but nothing else) accessibility relation between worlds just make the box operator into the identity operator?</pre>

<pre>@jcreed Yes, but identity is covariant instead of contravariant, is what&#39;s confusing to me. I don&#39;t see the validity of that contravariance rule for these interpretations, in the way I would expect.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed Ordinary modal logic (in the sense of K-derived systems like S4, etc) has a covariance axiom instead of contravariance, so I&#39;m not confused by ordinary modal logic. I&#39;m confused by the contravariance axiom being postulated here alongside an interpretation which seems covariant.</pre>

<pre>@alpha_convert @jcreed Well, it depends on what you call a modality. Negation (or necessary negation or possible negation or such further intensionally modal things) might well be considered a familiar contravariant modality.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed @alpha_convert @sivawashere I presume operators F for which (A &amp;lt;--&amp;gt; B) doesn&#39;t entail (F(A) &amp;lt;--&amp;gt; F(B)), where &amp;lt;--&amp;gt; is material bi-implication. Thus, intensional/non-truth-functional. But possible negation and necessary negation both have this non-truth-functionality.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@alpha_convert @jcreed @sivawashere Would you rule out possibility being a modal operator because you can define it as the De Morgan dual of necessity (classically)? Lots of things can be defined in terms of lots of other things, circularly, but what you call the primitives is up to you.</pre>

<pre>@alpha_convert @jcreed @sivawashere If you strip out all of the &quot;modalities&quot; from your logic, you won&#39;t have necessary negation around, and won&#39;t be able to define it either. So what&#39;s wrong with calling necessary negation a modality?</pre>
