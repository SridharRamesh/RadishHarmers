Text: Grains of pollen from various plants as viewed under a scanning electron microscope. Observe, when we zoom in on one in particular (morning glory pollen), that it appears to be made up of six-sided faces, with three of them meeting at each spike. https://t.co/WaUytojTC9

Text: But you can't actually make a ball using only six-sided faces. It's logically impossible (the reason why will be explained below). Indeed, if you look more carefully, you'll see that there are some five-sided faces visible as well. https://t.co/qKla794PsW

Text: Can you make a ball using only six-sided faces (hexagons) and five-sided faces (pentagons)? Sure. There's one very familiar way of doing so. It's sometimes called a "truncated icosahedron", but it's more familiar as a soccer ball. https://t.co/sgq15uyexG

Text: And here's another way to make a ball out of hexagons and pentagons. A hexagon on top with six pentagons next to it, and then the same pattern again in mirror image on the bottom. So 2 hexagons and 12 pentagons. https://t.co/cWt7YM8hj4

Text: There's another famous way of making a ball using only hexagons and pentagons; perhaps the most famous. Actually, it doesn't use any hexagons. Just 12 pentagons. It's called the dodecahedron, "dodeca" for those 12 faces. Pyrite crystals often take this form (albeit squashed). https://t.co/Rzu8Sx8kzL

Text: We've now seen four different ways of making a ball using only hexagons and pentagons, three meeting at each corner. The number of hexagons could vary quite a bit, but the number of pentagons was always 12. Coincidence? No, clearly not, or else I wouldn't have made this thread.

(Not that any of you care; this thread is write-only, I'm sure.)
