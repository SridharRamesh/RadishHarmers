Text: RT @RadishHarmers: A ring around my bathtub isn't enough to motivate me to clean it. I wait until I notice a ring around my body.

Text: TED Talks really blew up about five years in, when, in a Hail Mary pass to save the franchise, they decided to allow speakers not named Ted. Founder Theodore Edward Dee resigned in protest, but still collects a portion of the royalties from each talk aired.

Text: I couldn't pronounce my name until rather late in life (among other speech issues, I couldn't make the "sh" sound until middle school-ish; I forget exactly when, now, but there was a tongue surgery involved). And in retrospect, it's odd this wasn't a cause of more embarrassment…
