<pre>If you feel people aren&#39;t paying enough attention to issue X, go ahead and bring issue X to their attention, but I don&#39;t see what use it does to complain that they pay attention to issue Y, and to impugn Y as not worthy of redress because it isn&#39;t X.</pre>

<pre>@YangVentures A million things that happen all the time in the discourse. Currently, a certain amount of backlash I&#39;m seeing to people voicing worries over the teardown of net neutrality.

<pre>I don&#39;t like jokes that are anecdotes that are only funny if they&#39;re true. It is nearly impossible for me to trust them, and even when I do, I&#39;m bothered by the need to, the inherent conditionality of the humor in this genre.</pre>

<pre>Back in AIM days, I had a very specific system of differentiating haha, hahaha, heh, hehe, heheh, hehehe, LOL, etc. True friends understood.

Meanwhile, crude enemies just &quot;LOL&quot;ed at will, whether or not actually laughing aloud. No integrity. No care for fine discernment.</pre>
