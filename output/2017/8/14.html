Text: @jcreed Yup, that's it. In a regular category, we get the existence of epi-mono factorizations but not the uniqueness of epi-mono factorizations.

Text: @jcreed Eg: Ring inclusion Z → Q (epi, mono, not iso) factors as epi then id, or id then mono. These aren't isomorphic as epi-mono factorizations.

Text: @jcreed Any non-balanced regular category will do in the same way, of course (so, e.g., monoid inclusion N → Z works as a slightly simpler example).

Text: @jcreed Any meet semilattice is a regular category, and only balanced if trivial, so that even the "walking arrow" yields already a counterexample.

Text: @JoeHeavner @sigfpe Haha, ah, its use is to pass it down to others, who shall in turn, in some small number, find use passing it down to others, ad infinitum.

Text: @dsa_carter I concur. But I feel this way re: LOTS of things. Calculator-phobic curricula are a pointless hidebound frustration I could rant on for days

Text: @JoeHeavner @sigfpe It has its conceptual use, its proof-uses, in that it is in fact a true observation.

Text: @JoeHeavner @sigfpe Calculationally, I don't see it doing anything Gauss. elim. (which is just intro algebra written differently) doesn't do more efficiently.

Text: @JoeHeavner @sigfpe And while I'd love to see standard math curricula overhauled to emphasize conceptual matters, I doubt that's how Cramer's rule is presented.

Text: @JoeHeavner @sigfpe I suspect it is treated simply as voodoo formula to be rotely drilled on in some homework assignments and then forgotten (see poll results).

Text: RT @RadishHarmers: Did you learn Cramer's rule in high school math?

No
Yes but don't remember it
Remember it but never had use for it
Yes…
