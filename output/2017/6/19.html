Text: @sigfpe @jcreed If PA proves P terminates, then P terminates. The previous sentence is provable in PA; thus, by Loeb's theorem, PA proves P terminates.

Text: @sigfpe @jcreed And because PA proves P terminates, we furthermore have that P does in fact terminate (by the implication in the first sentence).

Text: @jcreed @sigfpe Not sure why either, when they have the exact same proof; GIT/G2IT is just the case of Loeb's theorem for Falsehood.

Text: @jcreed @sigfpe And the proof of GIT, if looked at in this light, works just as well for general Loeb.
