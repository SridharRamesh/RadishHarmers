Text: @vs_cointelpro Is there such a discrepancy, though? He claims to be 5'9", right? 4 inches shorter than Jordan Peterson? That seems about right, looking at the undoctored photo of him and Jordan Peterson.

Text: @SirJohnBurrito @vs_cointelpro If he's inflating his height by 2 inches, there's a little humor in that, as in various kinds of socially-instilled insecurity, sure, but not enough gas to keep the joke funny THIS long. But I'm also skeptical of the Net's ability to infer his height down to the very inch anyway.

Text: @SirJohnBurrito @vs_cointelpro And as with Trump's hands and other such, I think people are markedly exaggerating to themselves just how much this particular trite line-of-mockery actually needles the guy; as far as I can tell, all of us are now spending way more time thinking about his height than he does.
