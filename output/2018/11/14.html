Text: If those were the actual problems, the solution would be strict segregation by affluence (static lists of rich neighborhoods and poor neighborhoods), immigration restrictions, and reduction of workers' salaries.

Text: I feel like some of the discussion around Amazon is framed in a way which has the unfortunate effect of implicitly suggesting it is problematic for people to move to new cities, for neighborhoods to become more attractive to new people, or for employers to pay workers well.

Text: Also the problem:

Massive inequality, such that some get to have much more comfortable lives with much more choice than others, with behemoth corporations and individual megarich in particular wielding undemocratic power, including getting their whims publicly subsidized.

Text: The idea that housing must or ought be allocated by auction mechanism ("the market") is the actual fundamental problem.

Text: The primary problem is that there is such a thing as having to be able to afford to live in a place at all, such that it is possible to be priced out; that one's choice in where one can live is determined by one's income/wealth at all.

Text: (Of course, I would feel this way, as yet another tech worker asshole who just moved to a new city. So, with that full disclosure, feel free to disregard me entirely.)

Text: But again, people moving and neighborhoods changing and the existence of tech workers and so on do not seem to me the actual problem, and I think a lot of framing is misguided on this point.

Text: The Twitter thread with messages broken into Procrustean beds of 280 characters does not quite carve full thoughts at the well-expressed joints, but it is what it is; macroblogging is dead.

Text: Eh. I dunno. There shouldn't be such things as rich people and poor people, and as long as the system is set up this way, every position and every debate is just some horrid "theory of the second best" boondoggle.

Text: @zedtivx Even ostensibly lefty ancestral homeland talk doesn't much matter to me (a strain of thought that only reinforces ideas like land ownership which I'd rather get rid of, not to mention immigration restriction again, etc), but I'll avoid voicing too much heterodoxy in one day.
