Text: Twitter search often denies me the existence of results for searches I later confirm do, indeed, pin down specific tweets I was interested in recalling. It just randomly erases tweets from its memory hole, to be found again only with laborious infinite scrolling.

Text: Someone drilled into me when I was young that "good writing" means never using the same word twice in a passage, always taking care to use a new synonym instead. So now when I do accidentally repeat a‚Ä¶ word, I feel like I've committed a sin, violating some hard grammatical rule.

Text: 1. Only post the top drawer content you're most proud of. Pauca sed matura. Filter for you at your best.

2. Post entire stream of consciousness, whenever, whatever. Quantity has a quality all its own. If it tickled at least one person for a moment, why let any scrap go to waste?
