Text: @sigfpe Yeah, Twitter is a terrible medium for these discussions. Well, if you ever write your thoughts up in a blog post or paper or whatever form, let me know.

Text: Non-constructive proof that an irrational raised to an irrational can be rational:

Let X = sqrt(2) and Y = log(3)/log(X), both irrational.

If X^Y is rational: We are done.

If X^Y is irrational: In this case, consider (X^X)^X instead, and apply Gelfond-Schneider to its base.

Text: Proof of the uncountability of R:

(For convenience, I will use R to mean R_{&gt;= 0} throughout)

Let us say the sum of a multiset of values from R is the least upper bound of the sums of its finite subsets.

Text: Let f : R ‚Üí R be defined by f(r) = sum of {S(n) | œÜ(n) = r}.

Note that f(r) = 0 iff r is not in the range of œÜ. So our goal is equivalently to construct a zero of f.

Text: Fix S : N ‚Üí R to be any favorite sequence of positive values with a finite sum (e.g., S(n) = 1/2^n or S(n) = 1/n^2).

Let œÜ : N ‚Üí R be an arbitrary function (or even partial function). We will explicitly construct an element of R not in the range of œÜ.

Text: Note that K remains strictly increasing for as long as f remains positive on all values so far. However, K cannot be strictly increasing forever. (In particular, the range of K is a well-ordered set with some particular ordinal as its order type, beyond which K must stabilize).
