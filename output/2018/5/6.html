Text: @crulge Of course we shouldn't center the already well-off, as such, but this particular worry is odd. Who thinks the proposal is "We should all travel to Europe on our own dime and then use their healthcare"? The idea is clearly "We should do here what's been proven to work elsewhere".

Text: @crulge It seems to me a little overly paranoid to worry the disadvantaged will resent the "I saw with my own eyes the difference" messenger here, unable to recognize the argument being, uh, "messenged".

(But, eh, there can be framing issues I guess, so, alright; I'll leave it at that.)

Hey, you dumb kids! That word doesn't mean quite what you think…
[snickers]
Look up the word 'good'! (That's G-O-O-D). I think you'll find it quite eye-opening…

Text: @brocialistmeme @brocialistmeme Huh, did you delete all your old tweets when you went on hiatus, @brocialistmeme? I remember being happy with our conversation here, but I guess it is now lost to the sands of time.
