# The RadishHarmers tweet archive.

For now, just try going to something like <https://sridharramesh.github.io/RadishHarmers/website/2020/6/24.html>. I will eventually add proper index pages and all the other bells and whistles.

TO DO:
* Add proper indexing.
* Make things less ugly.
  * Background colors
  * The way text wraps around the avi, and general spacing relative to the avi.
* Display quote tweets, replies, and threads with links or embeddings back to other tweets on this page or to Twitter.
* Show embedded media (images and videos).
* User-selectable filters on what kind of tweets are shown (filter out replies, or show only one tweet).

During this hiatus away from tweeting, my focus is on math. Do you like math? You may enjoy some of the posts at <https://sridharramesh.github.io/HowSridharThinks/>. (Though that requires lots of cleanup too. My actual focus is on my thesis...)
