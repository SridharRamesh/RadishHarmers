Text: @Scrotes3 @xerosome It totally can. You can go make this yourself right now, out of toilet paper or the like. The only thing weird about it is that it's knotted, in a sense, relative to a normal wall; put another way, you can't do it without some bottom of the wall passing over some top of the wall.

Text: @Scrotes3 @xerosome One other note is that many are calling this a Möbius strip. This is not a Möbius strip. There are two distinct sides to the wall.

It is in itself topologically equivalent to an ordinary cylindrical wall; what is unusual is just the way it is embedded into the ambient space.

Text: This is a fun animation, but I'm seeing a lot of discussion calling this either an impossible object or a Möbius strip. Neither of those are correct. You can go make this yourself right now out of a stretch of toilet paper or such. And you'll see it maintains two distinct sides. https://t.co/aV4TelELjm

Text: (This is different than if you take a rubber band which ALREADY has height, and twist it into a figure 8. If you do that, you will find that walking along the top of the band will bring you to the bottom within the twist, then back to the top. That is not the case for this wall.

Text: It is just the same as if you took a loop of thin wire, twisted it into a figure 8 lemniscate (one part of the wire passing over another at the crossing point), and then thickened the wire into sheets of rock with height and a bit of depth.

Text: The actual unusual thing is the way this wall is embedded into ambient space. That is, it's knotted, in a certain sense, relative to a normal wall. Some bottom of the wall passes over some top of the wall, and you can't move it around to undo this without tearing and regluing.

Text: The two distinct sides would've been more manifest in the animation too, if some asymmetric figure such as a person facing out the window was used, rather than symmetric pots. You'd see this person always facing the same way when they came to the same point.

Text: @Scrotes3 @xerosome No. It has two distinct sides. Imagine a guy facing out one window. When he returns to the same point, he faces the same way. Or imagine an ant crawling around on one side of the wall. It will never end up on the other side (unless it crawls over the top or under the bottom!).

You could color this wall continuously with one side red and the other side blue. You can't do that with a Möbius strip. https://t.co/ZFnstMxwkt

Text: Yes, students can just as well memorize the solutions to x^2 - 1 = 0 as ±1. But are they also to memorize a formula for x^2 - 4 = 0 as ±2, and separately a formula for x^2 - 5 = 0 as ±√5, etc? Far better to understand a general method. This is the value of the quadratic formula. https://t.co/6xnl4eCqVL

My goal is not to dazzle mystically, this is what hate most about pop math, but rather to share perspective which makes things retroactively simple or even obvious.)
