<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We need more presidents like Ronald Reagan, who always wore a jacket in the White House because he constantly felt a little chilly, due to his decaying, diseased mind.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@Baddiel @Tankie_Viciedo You&#39;re the one who said &quot;there&#39;s an unconscious anti-Semitic effect here&quot;, dude. I&#39;m all for reading people correctly, but I can&#39;t see a way to read this where you didn&#39;t say this. If it&#39;s incongruous with other words you tossed in, that&#39;s only the incoherence of what you said.</p></blockquote>

Rather, this all started because some guy called Winston Churchill a &quot;white supremacist mass murderer&quot;. The facts support the elements of that quoted description.</p></blockquote>
