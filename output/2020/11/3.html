Text: @sextoy_mcguyver Yes, this is not a tweet. It is a sketch. I grant that the first page should be shortened, but my laptop and screenwriting software have each separately broken into unusability at the moment, preventing the simple revisions I'd have liked to make before posting this.

Text: @_______Leo_____ It is, but I also have some modicum of empathy whenever I see it. It's tough trying things, trying to be funny, potentially to fall on your face, to realize you lack what you thought or hoped you had, that you lack even self-awareness. There but for the grace of God go I.

Text: @PhoenixSarvesh Thank you. If you square both sides, you will find that 5 - x = (5 - x^2)^2 = 25 - 10x^2 + x^4; i.e., 0 = 20 + x - 10x^2 + x^4. There's a general procedure for solving fourth degree equations by radicals, but it's messy, and we luck out a bit here and don't need such generality.

Text: @PhoenixSarvesh 20 + x - 10x^2 + x^4 factors as (x^2 - x - 4)(x^2 + x - 5). Ok, the quadratic formula will give us all our solutions now.

Text: @PhoenixSarvesh We get four solutions, of which two involve 5 - x^2 being positive (the ones you presumably want) and two involve 5 - x^2 being negative (the solutions when sqrt(5 - x^2) is interpreted as the negative square root).

The solutions you presumably want are (1 ¬± sqrt(17))/2.
