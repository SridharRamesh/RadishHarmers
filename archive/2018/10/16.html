<pre>I am awake at 4 AM, though I could just as well be asleep. This decision would make sense if I was enjoying consciousness at the moment, but no, not particularly. Well, I&#39;ll give it another couple hours; maybe something awesome will happen. I&#39;d hate to miss out.</pre>

<pre>I feel like it means something that there were people on here with gobs upon gobs of followers, who got banned and had to come back with new accounts, who somehow didn&#39;t then recover anywhere near the followers they once had. All is chance, all is caprice. I don&#39;t know the moral.</pre>
