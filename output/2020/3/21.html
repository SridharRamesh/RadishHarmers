Text: It has only just occurred to me what an amusing coincidence it is for Thierry Coquand to have that name. His first name is like "theory" and his last name is like "Coq".

Text: All the other coronaviruses that aren't severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and instead just cause, like, stomach upset in chickens or the common cold, must be so jealous. Even SARS 1 is a has-been at this point.

Text: There's some sort of problem with my keyboard where it keeps accidentally deleting words without my realizing it, on top of repeated letters and the like. The terrible butterfly design. I will be taking it to the Apple store tomorrow for repair.

Text: America is cowed enough that we're going to come out of this with a third type of tax-advantaged Health Savings Account or some shit, and that's it, that'll be the only change to our healthcare system, the only septuagenarian the coronavirus can't kill.

Text: There's no way we maintain shutdown for a year, as some project. Not that the rates of adherence to quarantine are even so high right now, but a year would be unprecedented. People would sooner go around deliberately infecting everyone to bring cautious shutdown to an early end.

Text: In the post-Event landscape, mathematical logicians who do comedy, but not much, and don't do much math, and don't do much anything, will be most highly prized for their skills. Marauding gangs will compete for their favor. Their sizable harems will be filthy with coronavirus.

Text: I had my ambitions, but I can't work on most of them at the moment. I have nothing to look forward to. I need to figure out something to do, in the meanwhile, some motivation, till reality sets back in at some unknown date in the future. Fuck, maybe my thesis after all. Fuck.

Text: Losing my mind at this hour. Forcing myself offline for a day or so, to force myself into my lonely head, to think real thoughts for a second. It's dumb personed that I need to make an announcement to make myself to do this, but I'm a dumb person. I may just be hungry and sleepy.
