<pre>Easy things to ask on a first date that tell you whether they&#39;re worth deeper investment:

* Are you worth deeper investment?
* Were you lying just then?
* If asked &quot;Are you worth deeper investment?&quot;, what would you say? [Liar-proof]

All easily woven into first date conversation</pre>

<pre>I stumble upon a patch of ice on the sidewalk, tripping and falling and accidentally making a series of many separate mistakes over all the various years spanning my adult life.</pre>

<pre>In classrooms all over, teachers engage in shockingly insensitive behavior, instructing students to disregard the order in which items are multiplied (indeed, drilling &quot;(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab&quot; and the like). So many disheartening examples of institutionalized Abelism.</pre>

<pre>As I age, painful reminders of lost youth abound. For example, they&#39;ve long since stopped carding me at the supermarket! Granted, I quit drinking years ago.</pre>

<pre>@dannyburt33 Not just comics, mind you. Almost nothing I loved decades ago holds up to my current tastes. (And there but for the grace of God go I, as well, should I ever happen to be a comic people like, or an anything people like.)</pre>
