Text: @Hermit_Thrush Yeah. For example, when people say a bachelor is, by definition, unmarried and a man. No, by definition, a bachelor is a man and unmarried. That this entails being unmarried and a man is merely a logical consequence.

Text: I am trying to break into acting by being a seat-filler at the Academy Awards. Not for networking opportunities; god no,  I wouldn't bother anyone. Just for the experience. To develop the skill of sitting the right way, the way our finest actors do, or convincingly seem to.

Text: Twitter shouldn't ban people. You have all the tools you need in the unfollow, mute, and block buttons. If some folks enjoy satire without a clarity of purpose or target, readily mistaken for and contributing to that which it intends to criticize, what business is it of yours?

Text: The amount of ground game organization the Bernie campaign has is wild. Every canvasser logs how many voters their efforts reached. At the end, the one with the best numbers gets to be veep.

Text: Yang is so charming. Disagree with his policies all you want, I certainly do, but you have to admit, the man is likable; just a nice guy. If he ever switches from MATH pins to SOCIAL STUDIES or some shit, I will spit in his food and yell at his children.

Text: The reflexes I've developed help keep me suspended, arrested, in my personality-to-date. The muscles I've been tensing for a decade or two release only with difficulty, before spasming back. But now I'm stretching, day by day. I'll get back to adolescence by the time I'm elderly.

Text: @orgy_o_agamben @collnsmith I'd love to now post a great music recommendation, exactly what you were looking for. How amazing that would be. Alas, I cannot. But please appreciate my desire to do this for you now. Have you listened to "Our House" by Madness, or "Burning Down the House" by the Talking Heads?
