<pre>@FrankieG_Baby I&#39;m unfamiliar. Show me an example of general enjoinment from using mail; even the Unabomber is allowed to write letters from prison. As for imprisonment, it comes with a trial (though many of the people around me on this site are ostensibly for both prison and police abolition).</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby And sending conspiracy theory nonsense to interested subscribers seems to me not really to qualify as sending threatening harassing mail to victims; the latter harassment itself is a different criminal act.</pre>
