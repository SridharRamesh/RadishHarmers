Text: For all my leftist whatever, I feel bad about myself over the idea that potential employers aren't impressed by me, like it's a moral failing, an abdication of a moral responsibility to be impressive to employers.

Text: Actors love to play characters being really bad at acting, to make it look like acting is hard.
