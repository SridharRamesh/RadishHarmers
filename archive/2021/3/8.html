<pre>My dreams have gotten so good. Gripping plots with balanced A- and B-stories, strong comic relief, and escalation to resolution through well-architected beginnings, middles, and ends. I can do this shit in my sleep.</pre>

<pre>I&#39;m like the guy from Fight Club, in that I can&#39;t sleep and I&#39;m constantly talking to myself. I&#39;m exactly like if the guy from Fight Club retained those two qualities but didn&#39;t do any of the rest of it. They should make a movie about me, called Fight Club Guy.</pre>

<pre>@ella_em_ I found the first two seasons fun, but the last two seasons seemed too caught up in the dramatic narrative and not enough in just fun little episodic actor stuff, for my taste. Sigourney Weaver showing up was wild, though.</pre>
