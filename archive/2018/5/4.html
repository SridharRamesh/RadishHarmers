<pre>@doppelson Kenilworth! Oh, this makes more sense now. School rivalry or something. I thought it was a guy shitting on his own district&#39;s school field. I&#39;m sort of sad now that it isn&#39;t. That story tickled me more.</pre>

Eventually, it turned out, he wasn&#39;t Justin; he was Justin&#39;s twin! Didn&#39;t even know he had one; it was pretty funny…&quot; is about the right length.</pre>
