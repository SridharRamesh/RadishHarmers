Text: @postdocforever Sure, in a trivial sense that, like, constructing a computer program which will either at some point command you to kill an innocent, or run forever without halting, and then doing what it tells you, is either morally abhorrent or innocuous.

Text: @postdocforever But I don't see that this tells us something nontrivial re: morality. This only means the language we've allowed ourselves to pose questions about morality in has become too expressive for the metalanguage investigation of ambiguity of morality to capture the relevant curiosity.

Text: @postdocforever There's no obstacle to supposing that an appropriately narrow language of questions of morality could be formalized as a complete and consistent system, except for the objections to formalizing morality in the first place.

Text: @postdocforever These are not questions that impinge on any actual moral debates. We might say all the relevant moral questions, the ones which ultimately prescribe action, are quantifier-free. Quantifier-free theories are very typically complete and consistent.

Text: @postdocforever I'm not saying the question that's undecidable is a metaquestion, I'm saying the question of "Are there undecidable moral questions?" is a metaquestion. And the answer to this metaquestion depends on what one takes the scope of moral questions to be.

Text: @postdocforever Yes. Even many formal systems with quantifiers are complete too. Statements about arithmetic over continuous real numbers, using "for all", "there exists", +, *, -, /, &lt;, =, and Boolean operators, form a fully decidable formal system (Tarski Arithmetic).

Text: @postdocforever No, but I'm saying the only reason you should suspect any random system is undecidable purely on the grounds that "It's a complex formal system!" is if you happen to encode such questions into it. Like in the thing I originally called trivial and whose triviality you questioned.

Text: @postdocforever The question of whether a computer program halts is not a quantifier-free one in the sense that I mean. It's the question of whether there exists a number of steps N such that the program halts in N steps, where the potential values for N range over an infinite set.

If I can answer every question of the form "Does Turing machine M say so-and-so after N steps?", but leave unanswered some "Does Turing machine M ever say so-and-so?" questions, how does this impinge on my ability to answer moral questions?
