<pre>When Cleveland did it the first time, it already made headlines. &quot;FIRST PRESIDENT TO SERVE ONE NONCONSECUTIVE TERM!&quot;. No one thought he could do it again. But he showed them, returning after four years training and smashing all records with not one, but TWO nonconsecutive terms.</pre>

<pre>I haven&#39;t figured out how to talk about it without being hamfistedly moralistic, but I loathe the idea that each human needs to prove their worth, rather than being intrinsically worthy. What a relief, what a joy, it would be to live in a society without this pervasive challenge.</pre>

<pre>A young woman enters my mind&#39;s eye, and as she leans down to adjust something or other, I spot her tremendously broken down jalopy behind her, barely road-safe. Panting and salivating, I push her out of the way when she arises, blocking my view.</pre>
