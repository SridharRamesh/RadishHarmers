Text: Your pornstar name is Pornography. You dominate the search space, becoming the first pornstar billionaire. In your lavish life, surrounded by sycophants, you find you no longer remember the street you grew up on or your first pet's name. Snowglobe drops from your hand in silence.

Text: In a democracy, power accrues to whichever side has the most people. But the needs of the poor have been consistently neglected. The path forward, the moral imperative, is to make more people poor.

Text: @CarlBeijer There's nothing incorrect about it. It's just a phrase that has two different meanings. It's like getting mad about the existence of homonyms.

Text: @Vint13 @rahuldphys @vinayaravind @CarlBeijer The ambiguity is made up by crybaby pedants. No one is ever confused by this, any more than people are confused by the fact that "The right phrasing" can mean both "the correct phrasing" or "the politically conservative phrasing" or "the phrasing on the →".

Text: @Vint13 @rahuldphys @vinayaravind @CarlBeijer "The left position" can mean "the socialist position" or "the abandoned position" or "the position over this way, ←". Whatever. If there is some trivial ambiguity, well, that's language for you. That's fine.

Text: @Vint13 @rahuldphys @vinayaravind @CarlBeijer If someone wanted to say something "raises the question", they would, but when they want to say it not only raises the question, but practically begs for the question to be asked, they say it "begs the question". Good. I love it. Let them.

Text: @Vint13 @rahuldphys @vinayaravind @CarlBeijer Who says they're abusing philosophical jargon to sound smart? It's your misreading to assume they are trying to invoke philosophical jargon. They have no such intention. They are just using a stock phrase in their native language.

Text: @Vint13 @rahuldphys @vinayaravind @CarlBeijer Should we get mad at people who say "gilding the lily", for misquoting Shakespeare, as though their goal was to accurately quote Shakespeare to sound smart? Their only goal was to use a stock phrase in their native language.

Text: @Vint13 @rahuldphys @vinayaravind @CarlBeijer My whole point all along has been that it's perfectly fine to say a word or phrase that has multiple meanings and potential ambiguity. That's how ordinary language works and it's fine. Human language needn't be pared down for dumb robots who trip and fall on each Gricean pebble.
