Text: RT @RadishHarmers: My newspaper would always screw up and only print the first panel of The Far Side, so I never got to see the punchline.

Text: From a modern perspective, Boolean logic is the study of functions between finite sets and when their compositions are equal. Its particular history of arithmetic inspiration is basically accidental. Regardless, it's a naturally important concept, an abundantly useful tool.

Text: George Boole modeled his work after addition, subtraction, and multiplication (of zero and one). Anyone who is interested can go read what Boole wrote, it's all public domain and accessible online. https://t.co/ySZ4hEq3Ij

Text: But "colonial thought patterns" is a bizarre way to describe, like, arithmetic. Everyone in the world uses arithmetic and it originated long before colonialism. The very reason we speak of Boolean "algebra" (and "algorithms" derived from this, as in the OP) is after al-Khwarizmi.

Text: Not all formal logic is Boolean logic, not all logic is formal logic, and certainly not all arithmetic codification is automatically apropos and useful for whatever it is being applied to. I note all of these points often. There's all kinds of misguided things people do.

Text: But there's a lot of interesting stuff in mathematical logic, extending far beyond Boole. It'd be great if more people knew of it. I often talk on here about math, but rarely my area of specialty within it, so I grabbed this bait, though there was no need. https://t.co/ZUYo50nL90

Text: This constant "Math isn't a social construct, it's objective", "No, it IS a social construct", "No it ISN'T" discourse is just some meaningless online argument about words, affecting nothing. I don't know why you all let yourself get sucked into this framing all the time.

Text: I conclude as always by saying this person is basically fine. It's basically fine to make a foolish post online. I just want to use it as a springboard to talk about logic.

Text: @BenTormey I get the feeling she wouldn't, but yes, that (intuitionistic logic, as created by Brouwer and formalized by Heyting, Kolmogorov, et al) is a good example of formal symbolic logic that is different from Boolean logic.

Text: @BenTormey It would be great for more people to realize there are many different flavors of logic, not just one fixed thing called logic, even within mathematics. So I will allow her that much credit in pointing towards that, in a naive way, in a foolish framing.

Text: @WVOQuineHater I don't think the social construct discourse is exactly the realism/anti-realism debate, but I guess it's not exactly distinct either. That discourse is too muddled.

But I also feel Platonism is ridiculous. Gödel was misguided on that matter, Wittgenstein was right.

Text: @SweatieAngle Such broad claims are oft broadly true. It'd be great for people to appreciate there are lots of "logics" logicians study. Not everything is best viewed as taking one of several precise discrete options, Yes/No, True/False, rock/paper/scissors, so not everything is Boolean. BUT,

Text: @SweatieAngle I just don't think it's particularly useful to frame it as though piddling observations about Venn diagrams or whatever are so arbitrary or insidiously Eurocentric or whatever.

Text: @SweatieAngle People the world over have good reason to observe that "My background is not [logic or math or tech]" and "My background is [not logic] and [not math] and [not tech]" are equivalent, in the sense this is standardly said, and so on for all the other conclusions of Boole's logic.

Text: @SweatieAngle Such observations were made before Boole did his work (or De Morgan or Venn or Post and Wittgenstein, etc) and would have come to be formalized with the same rules even if he hadn't existed. There are many better things to attack as misguided applications of math than this.

Text: @SweatieAngle Not that you're the one saying this. I'm just carrying on my shadowboxing with the quotee of the OP. Now I have to look up this Adam Curtis thing, perhaps to be annoyed with him too…
