<pre>@pixelatedboat In my head, the number of chunks in every song in the database must be astronomical. Like if image search worked to recognize arbitrary frames of movies. But it&#39;s worth noting that I also don&#39;t know how image search is so fast. At least Google has massive resources.</pre>
