<pre>This is the Yorktown Heights (very nice area) home @Ocasio2018 grew up in before going off to Ivy League Brown University.

<pre>@matthewaraven I actually considered making this part of the post originally, but felt it ran into too much overlap with the historical figure Cleopatra&#39;s role in the heightening.
