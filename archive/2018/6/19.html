<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ModelOfTheory @TheMichaelBurge Of course, what people really mean isn&#39;t that the total of P(X = x and Time = t) over all x is preserved/invariant over all times t, but rather, that the total of P(X = x | Time = t) over all x is invariant (indeed, invariantly 1) over all times t, no?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gmail is now advising me on which emails to respond to, with counters of how many days it&#39;s been without my having sent a response yet. Thanks, but I can supply my own anxiety. (Hell, if you guys in Mountain View are running low, I have plenty to spare I&#39;d be happy to gift you.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@mrkgrnao I&#39;m on private, so you can&#39;t see me (unless someone else serves as intermediary), but, sure:<br><br>This is basically exactly like id : (s : Set) -&amp;gt; Func(s, s), and however you normally think about that will work for this.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@mrkgrnao If you like, think of Funct(a, b) as having type Cat^{op} x Cat -&amp;gt; Cat, where Cat is the category of categories (I&#39;ll ignore &quot;size issues&quot;). There is another map of the same type, which I&#39;ll call k1, which simply sends everything to the terminal category 1. [2/5]</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@mrkgrnao Your id : (c : Cat) -&amp;gt; Func(c, c) can now be thought of as a dinatural transformation from k1 to Func. [3/5]</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@mrkgrnao If you want to ignore dinaturality and only think about more familiar ordinary natural transformations instead, you&#39;ll capture less of the functoriality, but you can do it. For that, replace the category Cat by its subcategory CatInv containing only its invertible morphisms.[4/5]</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@mrkgrnao Now we can think of Funct(c, c) as in fact of type CatInv -&amp;gt; Cat, and can think of your id : (c : CatInv) -&amp;gt; Func(c, c) as a global section of Func(c, c); that is, a natural transformation from the constantly 1 functor to Func(c, c).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@mrkgrnao All of this could be rephrased in terms of fibered categories instead of functors with codomain Cat, if you prefer that perspective. [6/5]</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ModelOfTheory @TheMichaelBurge The unitary time evolution operator is the one which evolves/yields information about P(X = x | T = t). You shouldn&#39;t think of it as giving you any information whatsoever about P(T = t); the information it encodes and acts upon is entirely separate from that.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@realDonaldTrump It&#39;s surprising to me that nobody seems to have so far put together that this is basically a copy-and-paste from a particular recent article&#39;s headline: https://t.co/0i2RePimRZ. He clearly read that and jumped off from there. Right wingers there thus buttress right wingers here.</p></blockquote>
