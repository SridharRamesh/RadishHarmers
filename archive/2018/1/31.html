<pre>@Styl_oh It&#39;s closer to what my parents named me, anyway. I keep changing my mind about the sensibility of the notion &quot;correct&quot; here, when I myself have introduced myself to many people with the former pronunciation, but, yeah.</pre>

<pre>2. Why, at places where the train waits a long time before leaving (e.g., SFO) does the train initially open its doors briefly, then close them for a long time (sucks for you if you show up during this period), then open them again just before leaving?</pre>

<pre>3. Why are there always folks walking all along the train between cars in motion? Not panhandling, not simply searching for an empty seat, but still, for some reason, walking between and all the way through cars?</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby I doubt this idiosyncratic safety concern is nearly widespread enough to explain this behavior. I can imagine people trying to sync up with friends, maybe. 

(But also, I can&#39;t help but 
notice very racialized demographics to this, and wonder if I&#39;m missing something in that.)</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby I don&#39;t have any theory for it. It just happens to be empirically mostly black guys walking between cars (perhaps corresponding to who lives in the area, grows up riding the BART a lot and getting comfortable with it, etc. I dunno.). You&#39;ve never noticed?</pre>

<pre>It&#39;s the absolute most trite thing in the world to say, but I suppose I may as well say it from time to time, like so: Trump is horrifically awful (not uniquely shitty, no, but nonetheless quite overtly and intensely so). Never say I failed to acknowledge it.</pre>

<pre>It is absolutely true that who people find hot or not, supposedly as a function purely of their looks, is influenced to a great deal by their knowledge of the person and whether they like them in general, in other ways. This goes particularly for politics Twitter.</pre>

<pre>@martsendo Oh, or perhaps this was a joke. It is nice that the transcription for the second pronunciation looks coincidentally so close to &quot;Sridha&quot;. (But then, the hook looks like a little &quot;r&quot; too...)</pre>

<pre>@Monices_Pieces Yeah, this is basically what I&#39;ve always done to spot clean; just with trepidation about soaking the whole thing at once in a machine, for some reason. (I can&#39;t explain all my worries as rational)</pre>

<pre>@martsendo I was under the impression r-colored schwa was the standard way to write the endings of, e.g, &quot;butter&quot;, &quot;leader&quot;, &quot;diaper&quot;, &quot;higher&quot;, etc., in North American English (and that in non-rhotic varieties, one would just use an ordinary schwa)?</pre>
