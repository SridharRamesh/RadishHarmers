Text: The character "I" in my posts could be anyone. It is not necessarily autobiographical. He is simply an archetype, for any man or woman who is dumb and has all my particular flaws.

Text: The man hailed as a genius because he got rich owning a credit-card website you refuse to use because it sucks, allowing him to hire anonymous engineers to work on his pipe dreams, is throwing a shit-fit over crediting the artists whose work he posts. https://t.co/YDIGVJVHLV

Text: @sigfpe Associativity of stable states, under the operation that sends x and y to the unique stable state reached from their pointwise sum? Isn't this obvious, given the uniqueness of stable states reached?

Text: @sigfpe That is, letting a -&gt;&gt; b mean b can be reached from a via some sequence of moves, stable(a) be the unique state reachable from a with no further moves left, and a ^ b = stable(a + b), we have x + y + z -&gt;&gt; (x ^ y) + z -&gt;&gt; (x ^ y) ^ z, so (x ^ y) ^ z = stable(x + y + z).

Text: @sigfpe And just the same for every other parenthesization, granting associativity. That feels obvious to me.

I'd say the counterintuitive thing is the uniqueness of reachable stable states (though this becomes also obvious by thinking about confluent systems; just surprising at first).

Text: @sigfpe I should also acknowledge that "obvious" is a perhaps annoying word, and the whole point of math is that that things aren't obvious right away, and you do work to develop the tools to make them obviously obvious.

Text: @sigfpe But I'm just noting different reactions in what was most surprising to me about the basic idea of Abelian sandpiles. The order-invariance in the sense that it doesn't matter in the end what moves you choose; you'll make the same ones in some order regardless. That "Abelian-ness".
