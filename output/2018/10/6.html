Text: Though, also, eh, what could they do? The vote was always going to be basically just party lines (Manchin and Murkowski the few exceptions). It was never more than a slight chance away from a foregone conclusion anyway.

Text: I don't really know what I'm talking about, and there's no reason for me to be talking. How arrogant of me to presume I have any novel or noteworthy insight to bring to bear on the same thing everyone else is already talking about. (And clearly, I don't). I hope I shut up soon.

Text: @faceliketankbot I say you're doing a fine job; a true role model to be emulated.

Text: Does anyone know what it means when you have a dream where you're back in high school again but you start vomiting and can't stop vomiting, and then you wake up and there's vomit everywhere, and also, you're back in high school again?

Text: I hate everyone with a firm handshake. What are you trying to prove? What are you getting at with this 1950s-father-impressing nonsense? Let go of my hand, you're hurting me.

Text: Trying to remember the bathroom tile patterns of my childhood. I stared at them for a decade and a half; I should have this down, fuck. I am their last chance; without me, they are lost to the ether. Grabbing grid paper and playing around, hoping to jog some memories.

Text: The Banksy thing is funny to me. He sold a painting for a ton of money that then shredded itself, to everyone's shock; that's funny. Did he claim somewhere that it was super deep?

Text: The "Don't scream 'Help!'. People won't care. Scream 'Fire!'." meme withstands no scrutiny. Do risk-averse bystanders often rush into active blazes?

Text: Of course this rare JPEG of Eisenhower shaking hands with an alien isn't a Photoshop, you skeptical moron. They didn't have Photoshop back in the '50s! Now are you going to pay up or what?

Text: Radical change requires striking at the roots. Assassinate the six worst Supreme Court justices, and 90% of senators. Bring the Supreme Court down to 3, and the Senate to 10. There can remain 1 President. This whole thing was a dumb math joke. I saved its true nature for the end.

Text: [Angrily banging the roof with a broom]
Hey! You have a voice like an angel! I know it's tough up there, between the day job and family stress, but I'm rooting for you and hope to one day be able to say I knew you before you made it! So get off your lazy ass and back to practice!

Text: I need a dresser and a bed and then I'll be a proper human being again. Knowing myself, I will spend several months painstakingly researching the best of each, change my mind and restart the process, and finally obtain them just as my lease ends.

Text: Oh fuck. My kitchen and my bathroom are both in the same apartment. I've violated that most basic of principles, "Don't shit where you eat".
