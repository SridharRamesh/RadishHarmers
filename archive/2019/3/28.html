<pre>@Clueless73 I never said they were MÃ¶bius strips; my only claim is that these are how MÃ¶bius (and Listing) cut their own bagels ðŸ˜€. But note that the two interlocking halves aren&#39;t ordinary bagel halves; each is a double half-twist (as opposed to the familiar single half-twist) MÃ¶bius strip.</pre>

<pre>@Clueless73 You CAN also cut a bagel into a familiar single half-twist MÃ¶bius strip in the same way, but then you get one long connected piece, instead of two separate disconnected ones.</pre>

<pre>@SeanRMoorhead That might be what it is, I&#39;m not sure. If not a bug, per se, it is at least poor design to not clarify the situation for the user. There&#39;s no reason we should struggle to figure these things out for ourselves; that opaqueness doesn&#39;t have to be how software works.</pre>

<pre>@ConnorSouthard @badkuthi69 The story of the nerd originates in the Detroit area circa 1950; there is also an appearance in Seuss&#39;s &quot;If I Ran the Zoo&quot; (also published in 1950), but it is difficult to explain this as other than a coincidental homonym, unconnected to the relevant current sense.</pre>
