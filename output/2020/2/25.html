Text: If you happen to be a public figure running for president or the like, it doesn't even mean anything, there's no reason to get your feelings hurt, it's just a morally neutral law of physics that you will be made fun of by many people. Often in conversations you aren't invited to.

Text: Everyone needs thicker skin. No one is entitled to assurance that no one will ever mock them. No one is entitled to assurance that their feelings will never get hurt. Of course it hurts, but you're an adult. You must have had decades of training for this by now.

Text: @safe_steven Yes. I'm not saying you can't consider it rude or whatever, but yes, one needs skin thick enough to handle all that. As a matter of empirical fact, one is not going to be granted and cannot reasonably enforce a world where no one ever makes fun of anyone for whatever reason.

Text: Going DM-only for a week, to prove some point to myself about willpower which is false. My quip for Leap Day is "People born on February 29th are spin 1/4 particles". My reaction to South Carolina is told-you-so self-regard at having predicted it correctly down to the percents.
