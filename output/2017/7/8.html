Text: @sigfpe Hm. What are the allowed operations on this pointer type to be? Thinking of, say, Standard ML reference types, there's creating a reference

Text: @sigfpe (A -&gt; □A), dereferencing (□A -&gt; A) and updating (□A * A -&gt; unit). Those wouldn't match probability logic, with Loeb's theorem and such.

Text: @sigfpe Well, that can't be the interpretation in mind then (tho both support  □A -&gt; □□A, at least). So I must be misunderstanding the intended one.

Text: @sigfpe But I guess the idea is that these aren't dereference-able or re-assignable boxed types. And Loeb's theorem constructs circular data.

Text: @sigfpe I think of □A as meaning something like "the type of programs which produce As", in a context lacking an interpreter for its own programs.

Text: @sigfpe A program producing As being like a proof establishing witnesses to the truth of A.

Text: @sigfpe Program here meaning something like actual code, modulo some notion of code equivalence. Anyway, I'm going to stop talking.

Text: @sigfpe Right. And we can re-box already boxed data (□A -&gt; □□A) but not box arbitrary data at run-time (A -&gt; □A).

Text: @sigfpe I put in so much work with this phone, writing all the boxes, and yet I let it screw me into writing "probability" instead of "provability"…

Text: @sigfpe My PhD research was on a categorical interpretation of provability logic and I always thought of box as corresponding to "source code for".

Text: @sigfpe But perhaps this is just like what a boxed type is. Boxed Ts are essentially code describing Ts.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law @Laiilaispissed Just in further note on the Taj Mahal inspiration, it certainly seems that made-up "Agrabah" had at least some influence from, well, Agra…

Text: @Sturgeons_Law @Laiilaispissed Which isn't to say it "really" is set in India. The question is meaningless. Both the original and Disney's version are fictional jumbles,

Text: @Sturgeons_Law @Laiilaispissed made by people who didn't really care to make it specific, or even know quite what a jumble they made, most likely.
