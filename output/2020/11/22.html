Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe The key idea is this: Consider log(x!). This function satisfies the recurrence that its value at x minus its value at x - 1 is log(x). Thus, if log(x!) + log(x + 1) + log(x + 2) + log(x + 3) + … were meaningful, it would remain constant as x is increased by 1.

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe We might then find it natural to take it as constant in general, so that log(x + 1) + log(x + 2) + log(x + 3) + … = C - log(x!) for some C.

What is the value of this C? Suppose, counterfactually, that the left-hand side actually converged.

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe Then its integral from -1 to 0 would be -f(0), where f would be the counterfactual antiderivative of log chosen such that f(n) vanishes as n approaches positive infinity. And the integral of the right-hand side from -1 to 0 would be C - the integral of log(x!) from -1 to 0.

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe So we would find that C = -f(0) + the integral of log(x!) from -1 to 0. Plugging this back into log(x + 1) + log(x + 2) + log(x + 3) + … = C - log(x!) and setting x to 0, we have that log(1) + log(2) + log(3) + … = -f(0) + the integral of log(x!) from -1 to 0.

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe There isn't actually an antiderivative of log that vanishes asymptotically, but there is a sense in which the canonical antiderivative of log(x) is f(x) = x(log(x) - 1) with -f(0) = 0. So now we conclude that log(1) + log(2) + log(3) + … = the integral of log(x!) from -1 to 0.

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe This multiplication formula readily tells us the product of x! [or just as well the sum of log(x!)] over all rational x in (-1, 0] with a particular denominator, which for high denominator gives us our Riemann sum.

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe The above argument for the value of log(1) + log(2) + log(3) + … might seem very loosey-goosey and unrelated to the Riemann zeta function, but it can be given full formal backing both as a much more general series summation technique and in its relationship to the zeta function.

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe We want a canonical antidifferentiation operator such that the canonical antiderivative of x^p with respect to x is x^(p + 1)/(p + 1) [this is the unique p-analytic x-antiderivative that actually does vanish x-asymptotically for those p where such an x-antiderivative exists], and

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe Thus, by applying these two operators in both orders to x^p, we find that the canonical antiderivative of log(x) x^p with respect to x must be the derivative of x^(p + 1)/(p + 1) with respect to p, which is x^(p + 1) ((p + 1) log(x) - 1) / (p + 1)^2.

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe And let me expound on one other point from above.

I at one point moved from the observation that log(x!) + log(x + 1) + log(x + 2) + log(x + 3) + … is unchanged when x is increased by 1, to presuming it is constant in general. Why not take it as merely periodic?

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe Well, consider its second derivative. It is (second derivative of log(x!)) - 1/(x + 1)^2 - 1/(x + 2)^2 - 1/(x + 3)^2…, etc. But since our function is periodic, we may equivalently take the limit of this as x is replaced by x + n for large n.

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe This limit causes the convergent series - 1/(x + 1)^2 - 1/(x + 2)^2 - 1/(x + 3)^2… to vanish. It also causes the second derivative of log(x!) to vanish, by the asymptotic behavior of the log-gamma function.

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe Thus our original function log(x!) + log(x + 1) + log(x + 2) + log(x + 3) + … is not merely periodic, but also has a vanishing second-derivative; i.e., is affine. And to be both periodic and affine is to be constant.

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe We only need the two-factor case of the multiplication theorem: By considering recurrences and asymptotics, it's clear that log(x!) + log((x - 1/2)!) = log((2x)!) - 2log(2)x + a constant. By setting x to 0, we see that constant is log((-1/2)!).

Text: @yeetgenstein @sigfpe Double both sides and integrate from x = -1/2 to x = 0. On the left, we get double the integral of log(x!) from -1 to 0. On the right, we get the integral of log(x!) from -1 to 0, plus log(2)/2 + log((-1/2)!).

Thus the integral of log(x!) from -1 to 0 is log(2)/2 + log((-1/2)!).
