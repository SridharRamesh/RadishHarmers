<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@AliceFromQueens Twitter length limits are awful for discussing math, because anything that&#39;s more than two sentences requires an ill-timed break, not necessarily coming at a convenient point. Still, I will attempt it:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@AliceFromQueens Important details are always left out when people pose these puzzles, introducing controversy where there would otherwise be no disagreement to the brute counting. I&#39;ll reconstruct what I think you intend, and you can tell us if that is indeed what you intend or something else.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@AliceFromQueens I believe the setup you have in mind is that both A and B are aware, when asked to switch or not, of precisely the following info and nothing further: &quot;A picked 1 and B picked 2. Out of all such times, the prize is behind 1, 2, or 3 equally often. In this case, it&#39;s not behind 3&quot;</p></blockquote>

Out of all such times, the prize is behind 1, 2, or 3 equally often. Out of those such times where the prize is not behind 3, is the prize behind 1 more often than 2</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@AliceFromQueens Such a question asked in such terms would have no controversy. No one would disagree about the answer to that brute counting question. The only controversy is as to whether that is indeed the question you are asking. But that&#39;s up to you to say, no one else can say that for you.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@AliceFromQueens So, for example, A picks 1, B picks 2, Monty reveals 3 to have a goat, and Monty asks A to either stay with 1 or switch to 4, and Monty asks B to either stay with 2 or switch to 4? Not switching to the other contestant&#39;s door but switching to the unopened unselected door?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@mifzalmohd I agree with your much more important point about slanting and obfuscation of agency, but as a minor bit of grammatical pedantry, &quot;have been killed&quot; is in passive voice and &quot;died&quot; is in active voice. The grammatical concept of passive vs active voice is not the clarity issue.</p></blockquote>
