Text: No one's even going to remember any of these superhero movies in thirty years. Yeah, kids prefer flashy CGI toy commercials to black-and-white classics, but c'mon. Hundreds of years from now, our descendants will take their divine inspiration from enduring films like Clerks. https://t.co/umYoH1uAdz

Text: Love the results or hate them, one must from time to time simply marvel at the process, the world's longest-lived democracy. An unbroken chain from today to a hundred and thirty-two elections ago, when Christopher Columbus was voted in as the first president of the United States.

Text: Working on a joke whose logical structure is the same as Aristotle's paradox of the sea battle (the problem of future contingents). The character of me in this one is a real dummy. I'll let you know once it's ready. I hope someday to deserve a wife and family.

Text: The reason you do not want to see how the sausage is made is because you will witness that it is produced simply by wrapping sausage in sausage-casing, which raises a regress of questioning which shall haunt you forever.

Text: I love to mock my enemies as simps, to dunk on them for the praise this earns me, but as I desperately scan the Likes looking for my favorite fefos, I end up forced to recognize that I, too, exhibit my own simp behavior; that I, too, am a simp at heart. A double-edged S word.
