<pre>@BlewCheque @afraidofwasps It&#39;s ok. I just know that I will be annoyed as I listen in the details. Even this postulates it as though there&#39;s one fixed notion of what it means to talk about infinities and comparing their sizes. But there are many notions.</pre>

<pre>@BlewCheque @afraidofwasps This is a fine thing to say in some contexts but I know the context is never made as clear to the student as I would like. It is simply presented as mind-blowing fact. And I hate mind-blowing. I want things to be so clear your mind needn&#39;t blow, your perspective has simply grown.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@BlewCheque @afraidofwasps There are contexts where one would want to collapse to only one notion of infinity. Taking limits over the ordinary number line, say. Here, we have just one infinity. Well, sometimes one wants to distinguish positive and negative infinity, sometimes one keeps them the same.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@BlewCheque @afraidofwasps Then there are cardinal concepts, transfinite ordinal concepts. These are all distinct notions. These have multiple non-isomorphic infinities sure. Even here, we must be careful in how we talk.</pre>

<pre>@BlewCheque @afraidofwasps It&#39;s not always the case that, of any two non-isomorphic sets, one will want to say one is larger than the other. Such language is sometimes more obfuscating than helpful, like</pre>

<p>
<pre>@BlewCheque @afraidofwasps saying of two non-isomorphic groups that one is larger than the other just because of the lack of a suitable homomorphism. But sometimes this language is useful. It exists for a natural reason. It all depends.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@BlewCheque @afraidofwasps And sometimes one wants to say the continuous intervals [0, 1] and [0, 2] have the same cardinality but sometimes, in a very obvious natural way, one wants to say the latter is twice as large, which is true too in a different sense.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@BlewCheque @afraidofwasps All of this, I know, is rarely conveyed when people discuss this stuff. It just becomes mantras. So that&#39;s what I worry about. People get the mantra, they understand they&#39;re supposed to get a glazed over look in their eyes and go &quot;Whoa&quot;, but not the clear simple understanding.</pre>

<pre>@BlewCheque @afraidofwasps As Wittgenstein says about this example as well as others, people find charm, &quot;the pleasant feeling of paradox&quot;, in phrasing these matters sensationally, but it&#39;s often only sensational phrasing, distracting from understanding clearly the underlying mundane phenomenon. https://t.co/yJOQ52ieS0</pre>

<pre>@BlewCheque @afraidofwasps Anyway, I apologize for blathering on about this. I&#39;ll leave it at that but hopefully that illustrates my concerns. But, you&#39;re right that it&#39;s an ok thing to say in itself. Everything is context-dependent.</pre>

<pre>@BiigNick @afraidofwasps And he screws it up. He says there are more transcendentals than irrationals, and also appears to make the usual careless conflation of the number of irrationals with aleph-one. He concludes by saying &quot;I think there are five levels of infinity&quot;. Incredible.</pre>

<pre>@noamchungus @BiigNick @afraidofwasps You are correct. He screws it up very badly. Very very badly at the end. This is what happens when you focus on mind-blowing rather than clear understanding. https://t.co/9333Nb1oH2</pre>

<p>
<pre>@BlewCheque @afraidofwasps The nuance isn&#39;t even in the technicalities, though there are some of those to note. The nuance is the big picture questions &quot;What does language mean? What does it mean to generalize a familiar bit of math to where you end up saying something that sounds weird and wild?&quot;.</pre>
