Text: If you want to get it right, there's no escaping the work of evaluating substance. And incorporating knowledge of intent is very often part of that. You need feel no shame in it; you already use knowledge of intent in Gricean interpretation of manifold interactions every day.

Text: "Intent isn't magic" turned into "Intent isn't of any significance whatsoever" so rapidly. From the get-go, really, because people, in their admirable desire to be sensitive, tolerant, etc, keep trying to do so by rules, mechanical and superficial, a rubric requiring no thinking.

Text: Uber Pool added a passenger to my ride; annoying, but fair. Then it added another driver to my ride, and they argued the whole way about which route was best, but I get it, cost-savings. As they struggled for the wheel, as I prayed for escape, it added a second, souped-up engine.

Text: Given one shot with the device to correct history's course, I set its timer, head to the past, and upload my recently written Gangnam Style spoof, right at peak interest. The rickroll interlude is still four years past prime, but it was impossible to satisfy all constraints.

Text: Many of my memories, I don't even remember the thing anymore, I just know that it happened. This is bullshit. I might as well be allowed forbidden knowledge of future events, at this level of vagueness.

Text: @rahuldphys @IHateNYT It's just the automatic complete memory thing, not the audio commentary of everyone's thoughts. You can still rush to the patent office. (Note: I am not a lawyer, and therefore not prohibited from providing legal advice online)
