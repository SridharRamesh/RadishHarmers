Text: The dynamics of online are wild as compared to the world decades ago. A naked attractive woman isn't attention-grabbing enough, we're chockablock with that, so now one must use social justice slogans to get attention for one's thirst traps while claiming to be doing the reverse.

Text: Why do we report grades on a hundred point scale? 97 points out of hundred? Why out of a hundred? How arbitrary. How confusing. Could just as well have been out of twenty or out of six or whatever. Much clearer to grade on a zero to one scale (0.97, or 97%).

Text: Strangers oft reply to my jokes "I thought he was serious till I read his bio". Sound conclusion, but what is this reasoning? Sometimes people make a joke even if their bio isn't a joke. Some bios joke yet posts are sincere. It's not a one guard only lies, another guard…, world.

Text: You see that school? I built it, with my own two hands. But do they call me "Sridhar the School Builder"? No! And that road, that road was my doing. Do they call me "Sridhar the Road Paver"? No! But you fuck one sheep…

Granted, I fucked her a bunch of times. Still do, actually.
