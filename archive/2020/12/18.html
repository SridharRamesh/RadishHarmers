<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is dumb but so is everyone responding to it with &quot;just ban the Nazis&quot;, like some well-defined unambiguous thing. Everyone crying out for this site to be constrained to their moderation is why this site keeps trying dumb things like this, flailing around to appease. https://t.co/UXZJBuFVPz</p></blockquote>

Like if everyone with a phone was always crying over who else gets to talk to their friends on the phone.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@RegrettableDec1 Why are you so worried about drooling morons? It&#39;s fine by me if drooling morons have access to the same things everyone has access to, telephone and mail and groceries and whatnot. Or should we just execute them?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@RegrettableDec1 No one who self-labels as a Nazi is in the locus of power. You don&#39;t get into the locus of power by identifying with the universal buzzword for evil, the decades-old losing team. All the horrors of this world are now done by different powerful people.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@RegrettableDec1 So then the proposal is, let&#39;s ban people who don&#39;t identify as Nazis, who aren&#39;t literal Hitler-idolizing Nazis, but who are immoral in some other sense deemed equivalent by the Twitter corporation. That&#39;s just not going to accomplish what anyone hopes for it to accomplish.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@RegrettableDec1 As though &quot;Let&#39;s ban the Nazis&quot; would ever amount to &quot;Let&#39;s ban senators and cops&quot;. And as though doing so would bring about the desired outcome of everyone thereby agreeing, yeah, let&#39;s not listen to senators or cops, they&#39;ve got nothing going on. Like the tail can wag the dog.</p></blockquote>

Why actually grant the martyrhood of genuine censorship to all the people who already have victim complex whines?</p></blockquote>
