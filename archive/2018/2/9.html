<pre>@aZaphos I will note, this postulate could still hold in an intuitionistic world where &quot;Each person has red hair or doesn&#39;t&quot; fails. Dog ownership would have to be fully decidable, but the Law of Excluded Middle would only have to hold for red-hairedness conditional on non-dog-ownership.</pre>
