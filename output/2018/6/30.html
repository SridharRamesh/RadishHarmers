Text: Heading home from the city before midnight, to avoid turning into a pumpkin. One of those cool, hip pumpkins that dominate the nightlife scene. Pumpkins wearing sunglasses, even though it's already dark out.

Text: @smktty Yeah, but it was like what Brian Eno said about the Velvet Underground with him. (My followers, by comparison? Useless!)

Text: RT @RadishHarmers: Just thought of a good joke, which I'll be keeping to myself. You probably wouldn't get it; it's an inside joke.

Text: In terms of how I type laughter, I used to be a staunch "Hehe" and "Heheh" kid, but have over the years switched to being a "Hahaha" and "Ahaha" man. As go I, so goes the country.

Text: @SegaTape As a child, I had a complex, highly formalized system of doing so, with which all my close friends were familiar.

As a man, I no longer distinguish degrees of laughter. Always leave your conversational partner guessing.

Text: I bought a $45 #DCM20 ticket even though I hate improv, cowed by the etiquette of friendship, like an idiot. And what's worse, the ticket is in the form of a bracelet I have to keep wearing all weekend and explaining to everyone. Having friends sucks. Friendship isn't worth this.

Text: I've found it freeing to allow myself hypocrisy. And if I lob charges of hypocrisy at others, it only shows my commitment to this philosophy.

Text: I'm old-fashioned. To me, a proper date is something like March 10, 1885, or perhaps late July, 1927.

Text: A name's just a name and people can rally around whatever, but it's still weird to me that "single-payer" apparently is so scary or unappealing that it had to become "Medicare for All". Do people fear they might get chosen by Shirley Jackson-style lottery to be the single payer?
