<pre>@Hermit_Thrush Yeah. For example, when people say a bachelor is, by definition, unmarried and a man. No, by definition, a bachelor is a man and unmarried. That this entails being unmarried and a man is merely a logical consequence.</pre>

The muscles I&#39;ve been tensing for a decade or two release only with difficulty, before spasming back. But now I&#39;m stretching, day by day. I&#39;ll get back to adolescence by the time I&#39;m elderly.</pre>
