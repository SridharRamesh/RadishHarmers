Text: With enough Googling, you discover you've never had an original thought in your life. You never need even crack open a physical book to verify this disappointment; the past twenty years or so of global chatter already suffice to cover whatever you were thinking and about to say.

I plead guilty to self-retweeting, though, sure, and more generally, to sometimes writing things and sharing them on this site even though they aren't actually pertinent precious nuggets of wisdom. You've got me there.
