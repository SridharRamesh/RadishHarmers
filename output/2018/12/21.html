Text: Do not complain to me that you could see the punchline coming. Could you see it coming before I gave you the setup? No? That part was also my doing, credit is still deservedly mine.

Text: Season 2 better be all about the math professor, with a new lecture each episode. Apart from that, I have no interest in watching.

Text: That Pollyanna joke about how Mondays are the best day of the week, because they are the furthest from the next wretched Monday? Honestly, that's a great joke. Our dispositions are canonically opposite, and yet I feel a kindredness with this fictional child.

Text: @arishish Ah, I'm torn. I miss Freddie in that, yeah, let's not give credence to the idea of revoking tenure, precarious employment in general, etc, etc. On the other hand, yeah, IQ is dumb, and on that topic, Freddie was frustrating and much less interesting to me than his usual insights.

Text: All my anxiety jokes appeared to me in a dream, after tranquil meditation in lotus pose. I sip on hot cocoa in my smoking jacket, then stroll leisurely to the laptop and post "Currently planning on being happy in March. Let me know of any scheduling conflicts; I can push it back"

Text: If my kid asked all year for a kayak, and I didn't buy a kayak, and Christmas morning a kayak was under the treeâ€¦ I'd instantly believe in Santa. I'd murder whichever infidels he asked me to.

Text: The parents in Miracle on 34th Street/The Santa Clause/etc. lost not only their childhood sense of joy and wonder, but also basic logic. Gifts are showing up at your house you never bought! Maybe let that make a dent in your certainty.

Text: @arishish (Indeed, perhaps I fall into this by saying simply "IQ is dumb", I should've elaborated less glibly about what I found frustrating even from Freddie on the topic, except the nature of Twitter is that, ah, it's too difficult to express anything unglibly within these character coun

Text: To be clear, I find there to be a deluge of symmetric moncats every laymathematician deals with (every (co)product, all the various traditional tensor products). And with some work, you can find non-braided moncats of similar note (e.g. lexicographic product of binary relations).

Text: But the halfway house of the braided monoidal category, though very naturally arising from 3-categories, seems, to my chagrin, hard to motivate otherwise.

Text: @quasicoherence Huh, this seems promising, but I don't actually know the significance of this notion. What is the motivation for thinking about this particular braiding? (In particular, I would be excited to find a use for braided monoidal structure outside of topology)
