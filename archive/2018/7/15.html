<pre>I can&#39;t steal valour. I&#39;ve tried, but it slips right off me. People take one look at me, in my impeccably recreated uniform with carefully researched medals, and after some time forcefully announce &quot;You know what?... Not ALL troops deserve respect&quot;, before shuddering away.</pre>

<pre>@elektrotal And I&#39;m speaking from the point of view of a practicing Nazi. Look at your own linked image in https://t.co/pfT5ghWv0t, and then do 2 seconds of Googling of a Nazi swastika, to see that both turn in the same direction.

Tilting and dots are common differences, but not direction.</pre>

Fingers crossed they get it sorted out soon.</pre>

<pre>I know there&#39;s a ton of repetitive Musk-dunking content on the TL right now (and always). But the one force for good in Twitter addiction is how it yields such explicit revelation of just how banally stupid all the lionized rich and powerful are. Today is amazing. Let us indulge.</pre>
