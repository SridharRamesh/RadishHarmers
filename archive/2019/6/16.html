<pre>@sigfpe Associativity of stable states, under the operation that sends x and y to the unique stable state reached from their pointwise sum? Isn&#39;t this obvious, given the uniqueness of stable states reached?</pre>

<p>
<pre>@sigfpe That is, letting a -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; b mean b can be reached from a via some sequence of moves, stable(a) be the unique state reachable from a with no further moves left, and a ^ b = stable(a + b), we have x + y + z -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (x ^ y) + z -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (x ^ y) ^ z, so (x ^ y) ^ z = stable(x + y + z).</pre>

<p>
<pre>@sigfpe And just the same for every other parenthesization, granting associativity. That feels obvious to me.

I&#39;d say the counterintuitive thing is the uniqueness of reachable stable states (though this becomes also obvious by thinking about confluent systems; just surprising at first).</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe I should also acknowledge that &quot;obvious&quot; is a perhaps annoying word, and the whole point of math is that that things aren&#39;t obvious right away, and you do work to develop the tools to make them obviously obvious.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe But I&#39;m just noting different reactions in what was most surprising to me about the basic idea of Abelian sandpiles. The order-invariance in the sense that it doesn&#39;t matter in the end what moves you choose; you&#39;ll make the same ones in some order regardless. That &quot;Abelian-ness&quot;.</pre>
