<pre>@dirtbikehayes @KundainasheB @realest_lk Cuz her adrenaline&#39;s high and she&#39;s fucking terrified cuz a guy began chasing her at night, growling and calling her a dumb bitch?

It sucks to have to worry whether she was initially anxious on racial grounds, that&#39;s unfair, but her fear at the end of this is very understandable</pre>

<pre>@neyvay It really isn&#39;t (tho I realize it&#39;s also boring of me to yuck on people&#39;s yum or whatever, as I do all the time). But, yeah, such a mundane nothing-story, only of note if you happen to actually be in the workplace where it&#39;s unfolding and need to distract yourself till clockout.</pre>

<pre>@brocialistmeme It&#39;s true. (But also, my grad school years were in the same vein; my abandoned PhD thesis was on a category-theoretic account of Gödel incompleteness phenomena. Friends advised me to name my key concept an &quot;SR-category&quot;, the &quot;SR&quot; standing of course for… &quot;self-reference&quot;.)</pre>

<pre>@rogerbellin So simplistic and reductive of the &quot;Bell Curve&quot; set to suppose all cognitive ability boils down to one objectively measurable number. It is, of course, actually governed by two numbers (in conjunction with various die rolls).</pre>

<pre>Doing my taxes on April 1st to take advantage of the long-unplugged “You can claim whatever you want so long as you later shout ‘April Fools&#39;!’” loophole. Punctuating this sentence was an ordeal, and the results remain unsatisfactory.</pre>

<pre>@BreadvanWinkle @rogerbellin I&#39;m also worried perhaps I should have classified Charisma as a cognitive ability, raising the number of numbers to three. All around, my quips could use some work. My Quip stat (the fourth cognitive ability) needs some raising.</pre>
