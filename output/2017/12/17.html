Text: How do I spend my time? I do not make a fuss. I sit quietly and I stare at the wall. Hours later, to keep boredom at bay, I turn and stare at the next wall. After exhausting all four walls, it is time to lie on my back and stare at the ceiling. Next morning, the cycle continues.

Text: I've forgotten why I have the particular set of interests I have, having developed them so long ago, but now I'm stuck with them. I will not be switching horses midstream.

Text: I hear of far future dates (Election Day, or when the next season of some series I like hits TV, or whatever), and think "Aw, that'll take FOREVER to come…". As finally it arrives, enough calendar ❌s later, I feel pride like I've accomplished something, like it's to my credit.
