<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@lastpositivist @dog_envier The uniformity I have in mind is like so:<br><br>One is entitled to assert A v B v … entails Z once one has asserted each element of {A, B, …} entails Z. With an n-ary disjunction, there are n such prerequisite entailments, from which it follows that A v B v … entails Z.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@lastpositivist @dog_envier I see it as true. To infer Z from A v B v …, you need each of n many things to exist: a derivation of Z from each of the n elements of {A, B, …}. There are n derivations which all must exist; if all n derivations exist, you&#39;re good to go.</p></blockquote>
