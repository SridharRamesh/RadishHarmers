<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@donorsHATEhim Yes, a sequence being of order type omega means it is indexed by natural numbers in the usual way. But there are many, many order types beyond omega. For simple starters, there&#39;s omega + 1, omega + omega, and omega * omega.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@donorsHATEhim That is specifically what is not meant by &quot;transfinite sequence&quot;. A transfinite sequence means a mapping whose domain can be any well-ordered set.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@donorsHATEhim A simple example of a well-ordered set which goes &quot;further than&quot; N is taking all the indices in N, and adding one new index greater than all of them.<br><br>A bigger example is taking two copies of N, one after the other.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@donorsHATEhim An even bigger example is taking N many copies of N, one after another, in the sense of taking pairs of natural numbers, compared first by their first element, and then if they match on their first element compared by their second element.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@donorsHATEhim So, in this last example, we have (0, 0) &amp;lt; (0, 1) &amp;lt; (0, 2) &amp;lt; (0, 3) &amp;lt; … &amp;lt; (1, 0) &amp;lt; (1, 1) &amp;lt; (1, 2) &amp;lt; (1, 3) &amp;lt; … (2, 0) &amp;lt; (2, 1) &amp;lt; …. <br><br>This all comprises a well-ordered set, but it goes well beyond just the beginning stretch of (0, n) values corresponding to one copy of N.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@NightlifeMingus Yes, upsilon is a source of problems as well; it was an oversight of me to not call it out as well. Also, for some reason, it is the only one never used in math (and only just barely used in science).</p></blockquote>
