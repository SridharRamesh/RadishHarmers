<pre>If you have to get hit by a car, make it an ambulance. But if you have to get hit by two cars, either traveling oppositely or in succession, make one a subcompact, such as the 2017 Smart Fortwo with electric drive, while keeping the other an ambulance. Good luck and God bless.</pre>

<pre>Even after retirement, your Social Security payments depend on how much you got paid prior. Even after making it to the finish line, you are to sit and stew in your meritocratically assigned worth, all the better to be memorized for impending due report to St. Peter at the gates.</pre>

<pre>I&#39;m an equal opportunity offender. I&#39;ll mock anyone and everyone, whether they&#39;re a black gay Muslim, or a white gay Republican, or an Asian gay quadriplegic. No one&#39;s safe from my scathing wit.</pre>
