<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">From a modern perspective, Boolean logic is the study of functions between finite sets and when their compositions are equal. Its particular history of arithmetic inspiration is basically accidental. Regardless, it&#39;s a naturally important concept, an abundantly useful tool.</p></blockquote>

Anyone who is interested can go read what Boole wrote, it&#39;s all public domain and accessible online. https://t.co/ySZ4hEq3Ij</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">But &quot;colonial thought patterns&quot; is a bizarre way to describe, like, arithmetic. Everyone in the world uses arithmetic and it originated long before colonialism. The very reason we speak of Boolean &quot;algebra&quot; (and &quot;algorithms&quot; derived from this, as in the OP) is after al-Khwarizmi.</p></blockquote>

I note all of these points often. There&#39;s all kinds of misguided things people do.</p></blockquote>

It&#39;d be great if more people knew of it. I often talk on here about math, but rarely my area of specialty within it, so I grabbed this bait, though there was no need. https://t.co/ZUYo50nL90</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@BenTormey It would be great for more people to realize there are many different flavors of logic, not just one fixed thing called logic, even within mathematics. So I will allow her that much credit in pointing towards that, in a naive way, in a foolish framing.</p></blockquote>

That discourse is too muddled.<br><br>But I also feel Platonism is ridiculous. Gödel was misguided on that matter, Wittgenstein was right.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@SweatieAngle Such broad claims are oft broadly true. It&#39;d be great for people to appreciate there are lots of &quot;logics&quot; logicians study. Not everything is best viewed as taking one of several precise discrete options, Yes/No, True/False, rock/paper/scissors, so not everything is Boolean. BUT,</p></blockquote>
