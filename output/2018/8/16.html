I take a look. "A one followed by four zeros? That's not that impressive."

"Those aren't four zeros. They're two infinities."

Text: Mastodon also bans people for problematic content; in fact, it appears to be a keystone of its raison d'etre. So, good luck in a few years when a fifth of your faves get booted from https://t.co/kiJEEPMGQO for falling on the wrong side of its admins' civility determinations, too.

But I'm a man of principle, and I know there are jokes others would enjoy making, that I would enjoy reading, that would get looked at askance by 3rd party buttinskis with different senses of humor and power to police.

Text: So the guy loves prime polynomials; who doesn't? The fact that R[X] is a Euclidean domain for any field R, and still a unique factorization domain even if R is merely a UFD (thus extending in the same way to arbitrarily many variables) is one of the great beauties of mathematics.

Text: An interesting exercise in math for those (especially non-mathematicians) who haven't thought about it before is this: Why is the factorization of whole numbers into products of prime numbers unique? Why couldn't two different bunches of primes multiply to the same thing?

Text: @rogerbellin In some sense, sure, but I think this particular fact sits at an especially interesting point in the contrast between the certainty with which laypeople are made aware of it, and yet the lack of awareness, even upon reflection, of certain neighboring phenomena undergirding it.

Text: @rogerbellin Whereas, if I asked say, why adding 7 to itself 5 times is the same as adding 5 to itself 7 times, and so on for arbitrary values, I am reasonably confident most adults and large children could give me a solid explanation soon enough.

Text: @rogerbellin I've run this experiment in the wild (of course, with the sort of people who are in my circles, so often people comfortable with math to a baseline extent but not mathematicians; coders and scientists and the sort) and routinely folks say "Well, it's just obvious, isn't it?!".

Text: @martsendo One thing to keep in mind is that this proposed argument didn't use the assumption of being prime anywhere, so it couldn't have worked. (For if it had worked, it would've just as well shown that 2 * 6 couldn't equal 3 * 4.)
