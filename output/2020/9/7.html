Text: @tangentmeasure @stevenstrogatz In this video, it's not that clockwise direction is positive, but rather, "Output swings the same way the input swings" is positive.

Text: @tangentmeasure @stevenstrogatz It's also true that I often happen to like illustrating swinging over input loops clockwise, because "clockwise" is easier to say and I'm not bothered by arbitrary conventions beyond that. But I want to be clear about the above point.

Text: @tangentmeasure @stevenstrogatz You could traverse these input loops in either direction and would get the same winding number sign, in the sense of this video.

Text: @jpdoane @stevenstrogatz For an arbitrary continuous function, any region with nonzero winding number contains a zero.

For holomorphic functions, we also have a converse: any region containing a zero has nonzero (and also non-negative) winding number. This is not true of arbitrary continuous functions.

Text: @jpdoane @stevenstrogatz The observations here for 2D continuous functions are just like how, in 1D, a continuous function has zeros within any interval on which it changes sign (the Intermediate Value Theorem), but a continuous function may also have zeros that do not correspond to any sign change.
