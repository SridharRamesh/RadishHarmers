<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@MarkMacyk Dear everyone saying this joke was stolen from Demi: This joke wasn&#39;t stolen from Demi. This is a joke a new person comes up with once a month, no doubt often independently. Demi was far from the first. Alan Wheat was the first, beating Demi by four years. https://t.co/JsZuvEDMEO</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@rahuldphys I appreciate the effort, but the amount of interpretation necessary to define &quot;rational text&quot; as meaning essentially &quot;finite text&quot; is such that I must decline to Like this post, for reasons of mathematical fidelity.</p></blockquote>

It&#39;s true that the joke is often phrased with infinitely many monkeys (though neither Borel nor The Simpsons did so); however, this changes little in my pedantic qualms:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@rahuldphys Now, it&#39;s true that one can encode an infinitely long eventually periodic text as a finite text (using the scheme of encoding it as the finite nonperiodic part followed by some separator symbol followed by the finite text to be repeated ad infinitum, say).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@rahuldphys Is your claim that, given countably infinitely many monkeys, each typing a countably infinitely long text at independent uniform random, the probability is 100% that every eventually periodic infinite text is produced by some monkey?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@rahuldphys That claim is false. In fact, with probability 100%, not a single monkey produces an eventually periodic infinite text. It&#39;s exceedingly unlikely (indeed, probability 0) to from some point on repeat some finite pattern infinitely without ever deviating.</p></blockquote>
