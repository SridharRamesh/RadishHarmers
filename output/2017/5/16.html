Text: Not true if num chickens not divisible by 4. Anyway, I don't yet know why this is the case; I've just observed it empirically for lower N.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 Why do they say "This is not a defect of [such] statistical tests"? All/many null hs being false would seem to me a defect of null h testing
