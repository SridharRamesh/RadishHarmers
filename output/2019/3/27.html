Text: Mia Farrow is right about Myst. And also about Riven. She's not just some casual fan who only stuck around for the mainstream original.

Text: Myst III: Exile: Very pleasant. Not entirely the same, you can tell it was made by different people, but still quite good.

Myst IV: Revelation: Starts off seeming like it will be quite good, ultimately a tedious disappointment.

I never bothered with Myst V. My heart was broken.

Text: A cool lifehack for becoming Online is to move. All your in-person friends instantly become online friends, and what was "local Twitter" now counts as just Twitter. Do not ask me why one would do this. I'm working on it.

Text: @Discourse_Stu Politics isn't posting, of any kind. Politics is following, of me. (Alas, the site does not allow me to perform politics on my main; I must resort to an alt for that.)

Text: Yes, you can do this to an ordinary bagel, with no special preparation, no glue, no cheating, just cutting it appropriately to get two interlocking unbroken rings. Turn your knife around through 360 degrees vertically (roll/pitch) as it yaws 360 degrees around the cutting plane.

Text: @sodburger Have some extra practice bagels ready. In my own experience, the first bagel you try this on might get screwed up, but then the second one should be easy and you'll get the hang of it.

Text: @sodburger At the point where it seems like you should now be be holding the knife inside the hole and cutting outward, you can switch and make the same cut from the outside in toward the hole, if that's what you're talking about.

Text: @sodburger I.e., you start off cutting with your hand on the black line and the knife tip on the red line, then you switch to cutting with your hand on the red line and the knife tip on the black line once that's easier.
