<pre>I got up early to watch this live when it premiered, introduced by a message from President George Bush and Barbara Bush. Then when it came out on video, I rented it a million times, and then I copied the VHS and watched that a million times.</pre>

<pre>@ProfOak @Sturgeons_Law @KumarsSalehi Yeah, I think this is an indirect side-effect of Elizabeth Bruenig tweeting that Stormy Daniels&#39; media presence illustrates &quot;filthy&quot; &quot;vulgar&quot; &quot;salacious&quot;ness...</pre>

<pre>@ProfOak @Sturgeons_Law @KumarsSalehi I guess even simply by mentioning this I&#39;m shit-stirring here, but I really just intend to communicate information to people who are curious. Here you go. That last line, which, yeah, made my eyes roll, is probably part of how this conversation about the Christian left got going. https://t.co/MTeV44RIbT</pre>

<pre>@ProfOak @Sturgeons_Law @KumarsSalehi (If I must stake out a &quot;position&quot;, since I&#39;ve now shit-stirred, it&#39;s that I&#39;ve admired things she&#39;s written, but I also find stuff like that line eye-rolling and &quot;pro-life&quot; politics abhorrent. But I&#39;m no expert on the Bruenigs&#39; politics or nature. I just see tweets sometimes.)</pre>

<pre>@Sturgeons_Law @ProfOak @KumarsSalehi Right, I actually don&#39;t know, which is why I must make the qualification: I don&#39;t know anything about her politics in any detail. (All TradCath stuff is eye-rolling, but I don&#39;t know where she lands on the spectrum from silly to concerning.)</pre>

<pre>@inshallahvolcel @ProfOak @Sturgeons_Law @KumarsSalehi I would&#39;ve assumed this too, given her leftist credentials, but given the way other people talk about her in relation to the issue, maybe not? But perhaps people misrepresent her. I honestly don&#39;t know.</pre>
