But I recognize my own thirst and indeed my own incredibly try-hard posting in my own way. All people are my brothers and sisters.

Or maybe I can. I can do lots of things, if I put my mind to it. I went to school and learnt all the tricks, all the ways to twist myself with logic.

Text: @DukeGreene I don't see the salience of the first of these. However, I think the second is correct. Warren's camp can no longer feasibly claim to want largely the same things Bernie wants, as they once claimed. Nader, of course, never pretended to stand for nearly the same things as Gore.
