Text: The population of Iowa isn't even that large. They've probably all been polled several times already. At this point, no polling can be trusted, due to the statistical phenomenon known as "oversampling".

Text: @jeremyjkun @dodecahedra What practical benefit do you get by calling them the same? Why not call them "different" and disambiguate what you mean if/when it matters?

Text: @dodecahedra Are

f: ℤ/2ℤ → Colors
f(0) = Red
f(1) = Blue

and

g: ℤ → Colors
g(2n) = Red
g(2n + 1) = Blue

the same function (domains are not real) or different functions?

Text: @jeremyjkun @leland_mcinnes @dodecahedra The original post gave an example of when that distinction is helpful: when you want to be able to say some functions are surjections and other functions are not surjections, you need to consider the data of a function as including a codomain potentially distinct from its range.

Text: @jeremyjkun @leland_mcinnes @dodecahedra It is of course also the case that sometimes one does not want to bother with such a distinction. Everything in math is always context-dependent. Are the ring of complex numbers and the ring of [[a, b], [-b, a]] matrices the same or different?

Text: @jeremyjkun @leland_mcinnes @dodecahedra Is the homotopy group of the circle the integers? Are the set {Yes, No} and the set {0, 1} the same or different? Is the speed of light 1?

Text: @jeremyjkun @leland_mcinnes @dodecahedra Sometimes, one wants to identify them along a thus elided isomorphism and sometimes, one has reason not to. Every instance of "same"/"different", or any other preformal language for that matter, is context-dependent.
