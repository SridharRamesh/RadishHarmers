<pre>@ligneousTyler @HelpfulKraken I see both @HelpfulKraken and I converged on the same idea framed similarly, playing out logically from the quoted tweet. I had not seen @HelpfulKraken&#39;s tweet until now (I get no validation jollies by stealing), but I acknowledge it was prior to mine. https://t.co/GjtKWHe8KI</pre>

<pre>I would take a vow of silence for a year, if I were 25. Now, there isn&#39;t enough time left.</pre>

<pre>@nobagdad @darth_erogenous If strapping someone to a board, gagging their mouth and nose, and pouring water on them doesn&#39;t count as touching someone, then firing a bullet into someone&#39;s face might as well not count as touching them.</pre>

<pre>@haircut_hippie I think I&#39;m over that now. I&#39;m in a generally decent overall mood these days. I&#39;m in some shallower rut now. Maybe I&#39;m just out of practice doing things.</pre>

<pre>@jeb_bush_2020 @shreyabasu003 @rens_twi A domicile is too big for you to hope to not have any mosquitoes already in there somewhere, or be able to effectively purge the whole place if one gets in. A bed is the right size that you can establish it as mosquito free when you put up the net and thus keep it that way.</pre>

<pre>@CarlisiSteve @doormatmccarthy @darth_erogenous I&#39;d certainly like to believe that&#39;s what Colin was doing, being sarcastic. It&#39;s possible, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll have to investigate the context more.</pre>

<pre>@CarlisiSteve @doormatmccarthy @darth_erogenous Hm, I really don&#39;t think he&#39;s being sarcastic. I think it&#39;s just that 2004 era War on Terror mindset everyone deferred to at the time. https://t.co/8JtKzKiJwm</pre>

<pre>People get more conservative as they age. I&#39;ve observed extensive evidence of this pattern in studying the casual prejudices of beloved characters created decades ago, alongside the windows into their woker youth available from recently made prequels.</pre>

<pre>Do people still say &quot;woke&quot;? I think maybe not, but there must be some word people still use for a similar meaning. It is important I learn these things. We must continually be learning.</pre>
