<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I first learnt the rules of football, what downs meant etc, from a family friend&#39;s manual for the SNES game Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose!, which featured an Acme Looniversity Football stage. I didn&#39;t own the video game and would not go on to play it for several years.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m renewing my focus on a project that should be straightforward if I commit myself to actually doing it. It&#39;s not a comedy thing and most of you will not care about it at all. Once it&#39;s done, I&#39;ll feel freed to do whatever. Retweet my greatest hits in the meanwhile.</p></blockquote>
