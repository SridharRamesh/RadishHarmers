<pre>I happened to buy avocado toast Saturday morning, before everyone cared. With 100% sincerity, it was delicious and my life is a shambles.</pre>

<pre>Actually, my one more comment is that the ubiquity of avocados is the one thing I will keenly miss when I finally move out of California.</pre>

<pre>With 4N chickens, the number of unpecked chickens is symmetrically distributed (probability of x matches probability of 2N - x).</pre>

<pre>Not true if num chickens not divisible by 4. Anyway, I don&#39;t yet know why this is the case; I&#39;ve just observed it empirically for lower N.</pre>
