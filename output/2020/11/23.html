Text: @sigfpe That probably is the impetus for putting these up, but I actually am curious about the scientific question of their safety. It seems everyone feels they're much less safe than eating outdoors, but if the windows are unsealed, are they actually so much worse and why? I am curious.

Look at these dummies with all their absurd archaic attitudes about sex and race and childrearing and smoking and so on. How did they not know, their weirdness? Thank god we've got it all figured out now. Thank god we live outside time.

Text: In 4th grade I was curious what algebra was, so I got a book from the elementary school library. It discussed abstract structures, associative, commutative, etc properties, permutation groups (illustrated as tire rotation patterns), "algebras" as associative algebras, and so on. https://t.co/iv3X3oxrxd

Text: It was years before I realized this wasn't what "algebra" ordinarily means (either in the associative algebra sense or the broader abstract algebra sense), that middle school algebra wouldn't be about this, that there's just all these different meanings of the word.

Text: Just such rudiments as I noted above. Nothing on homomorphisms as I recall. I don't even remember the word "group" being used. But permutations under composition were illustrated as an example of an associative structure (again, notably illustrated as swapping tires on a car).

Text: And words and concepts like "associative" and "commutative" I learnt there, and finite tables were given defining abstract operators and inviting the reader to check which properties they satisfied, culminating in this definition of the word "algebra" as some ring-like structure.
