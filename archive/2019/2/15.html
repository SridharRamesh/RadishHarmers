<pre>@sodburger I hate to break it to you, but this site is dumb.

(Also, obsessed with a particular sad six-word story apocryphally attributed to Hemingway, in case that part wasn&#39;t clear. But mainly, the phenomenon is a dumb key fitting a dumb lock.)</pre>

<pre>Let f_N = (-d/dx)^N cos(x^½) and y = 1/(4x).

See inductively: f_N = P(y)f_0 + Q(y)f_1 for some P, Q ∈ ℤ[y] of degree O(N).

And by Taylor series: f_N(x) ~ f_N(0) = N!/(2N)! = o(ε^N) as N → ∞.

Let x^½ = π/2. Now Q(y) = o(ε^N) though Q has degree O(N). So y ∉ ℚ.

π^2 ∉ ℚ.</pre>

<pre>@matthewaraven Every now and then, I set for myself the challenge of trying to fit certain bits of math into a single tweet. In this case, the argument for why π is irrational (indeed, demonstrating even its square is irrational).</pre>

<pre>@matthewaraven Of course, what the challenge most forcefully demonstrates in the end, unfortunately, is not so much my cleverness, as the unsuitability of Twitter for discussing math.</pre>

<pre>@martymacmarty We lash out most against the people who are mostly like us but slightly different, thus still in our circles and who we can get mileage out of defining ourselves in contrast to, rather than those so very different that we rarely actually interact with them.</pre>

<pre>@martymacmarty Freddie (enemy #6, yet also often sadly hypocritically cantankerous himself) had a good blog post about this once, now vanished into the either. The way people who aren&#39;t actually religious themselves somehow have more rage for Reddit atheists than Christian fundamentalists, say.</pre>
