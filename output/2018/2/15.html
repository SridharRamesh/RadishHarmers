Text: @FrankieG_Baby Actually, every time you see me being pedantic, it's because I am, at that very moment, having sex.

Text: Been waiting half an hour for a Lyft to get to the BART to go home from work. One said he was here, then said he couldn't find the building, then cancelled. Another showed up, I got in, he suddenly yelled at me and said I closed his car door too fast (?!), and told me to get out.

Text: Goddamn, I hate commuting. It's an hour and a half anyway, but looks like I'll be adding another fifty minutes of wait time onto it today. I need to get out of this place.

Text: I follow a lot of strangers online who hate each other. I have many better things to do than stay up-to-date with the ongoing drama of nichely well-known Netfolk whose ages I blew past years ago. But, I'm trying to figure out the right kids to shit on as well. I want to nail it.

Text: Many years ago, my kid cousins made me those arts and crafts things ironed together from beads. I've kept them in my various laptop bags, etc. I lost one when I was mugged. Another, to the ravages of time, or so for its integrity, yet I still find stray beads from it, even now.

Text: @lorismentality In math, I think there's generally good reason to devise special terminology for various abstract concepts, but the particular terminology picked is almost always so bad.

Text: Hours later, irrelevantly, this still kinda bums me out, per my idiom. Fuck off, random Lyft guy; I got in your car totally normally and you were a weirdo asshole to me. (My only consolation is that you follow me on Twitter and will see this excoriation…) https://t.co/CwlsemZ1t1

Text: @christapeterso I've had so many tense interactions with strangers for completely inexplicable reasons recently. Just last Friday, a guy in front of me on the BART started yelling at me and threatened to smash a bottle into my face (and again, at first, I thought it was somehow my fault…).

Text: @christapeterso I'd guess BART guy was unwell, but I didn't realize it until well into "Huh? Oh, I'm sorry, sir; did I accidentally do something I ought apologize for? Wait, wha— Oh, fuck, how do I get out of this situation? Just look at the ground and don't say anything till he leaves…" panic.

Text: @_Pinback It's at least standardly pronounced that way, which is another thing Westerners almost always assume differently.

(Granted, pronunciation varies across any large group of people; I shouldn't imply there is only one pronunciation among Hindus either.)
