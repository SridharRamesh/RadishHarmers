Text: last, I relax (laughing exhilaratedly, then settling into a smile). I take out the locket again, kissing it over and over with relief, drifting calmly downwards.

While I do so, slowly, my plane re-enters view at the bottom of frame, directly below, matching my horizontal [4/5]

Text: imparting horizontal thrust of their own]). Actually, I don't know how it works in reality, but at any rate, we would play this out, not get into it all in the pilot (hehâ€¦ you know what I mean). We could discuss these and more of the relevant engineering issues over the course

Text: I'm honestly, in my comedic sensibilities, rather a bit of a prude; just along different axes than certain ones oft-invoked for superficial evaluation and scolding. Such mechanical rubrics seem to me completely broken, but I have my own standards I don't always hit.

Text: @mtracey @Tankie_Viciedo Michael, I honestly think you get a lot of unfair shit you don't deserve, I think people read you in perverse bad faith all the time, but c'mon, this is an easy one. 3 words and it's done. It's not even a big claim. All presidents are bad, all billionaires are bad, it's so easy.

Text: @Tankie_Viciedo @mtracey Oh, I don't know about that last part. I've heard rumblings of various separate campaigns, supported by high-level figures in the U.S. government, seeking over the next couple years to remove and replace the President. Not sure how realistic such meddling ambitions are, though.
