Text: I actually think the post everyone including me is quote-tweeting and making fun of is fine. It's fine to say something dumb, idle chatter, most posts are fine. They're just springboards for me to make my own jokes. When those are dumb, it's fine too.

Text: @feraljokes This is correct, it's dumb to main character someone over this, it's dumb to take it as worth such attention at all, that someone in a world of 7 billion people maybe said something foolish. But also, I think a post with 25K Likes can take some ribbing as well. She'll be fine.
