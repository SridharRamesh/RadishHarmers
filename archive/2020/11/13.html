<pre>@dhk242 Everyone makes fun of the idea, as such things only attract weirdos, but it honestly is hard to find anyone swiping through dating apps who isn&#39;t a very basic liberal, in my experience. I love all my liberal friends, but I&#39;ve come to want some more compatibility in such outlook.</pre>

<pre>My father reminisced to me about a toy I had when I was young, a toy car with a part that flipped up and shot a red ball that in turn opened up. One toy among dozens. I remember it well, but that my father remembers such details of some old toy of mine strikes me as very sweet.</pre>

<pre>PEMDAS, my ass. Literally the only useful thing that PEMDAS/BODMAS/whatever conveys correctly is that, where there would otherwise be ambiguity, notational convention is for multiplication to take precedence over addition/subtraction. A more apt mnenonic would be My ASs.</pre>
