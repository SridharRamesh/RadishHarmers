Text: @KRASNEROCALYPSE I'm not going to count Bacon numbers as genuine for non-speaking extras (nor for documentaries). This leaves open a fighting chance for this dumb challenge. 

Not that I'm gonna get Erdös number 2 either; my best shot is 3 through my advisor, if I ever get off my ass and publish.

Text: @ttersucksbutt A handy mnemonic is that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, while (in the naive views of the early Wittgenstein) philology recapitulates ontology. I just made this mnemonic up and, like most mnemonics for two items, it's not actually useful for remembering which is which. Enjoy.
