Text: In the future, kids will browse Internet archives from the past in history class. See, kid? I predicted this. Also, I agree, kid: school sucks.

Text: @bridgietherease @clementix In case anyone is still wondering about this, the second book was "On Certainty", by Wittgenstein. Though really, I am using it as metonymy for all of the later Wittgenstein.

Text: @BlueyMcPhluey When you gaze long into the truncated icosidodecahedron tiling, the truncated icosidodecahedron tiling gazes also into you.

Text: @bridgietherease @clementix Even Wittgenstein came to feel the Tractatus was a mistake!

I came to Wittgenstein differently from how I think most people do (originally via "Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics" and "Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics"), but he was very influential for me.

Text: @BlueyMcPhluey Though rather than think of this as the "truncated icosidodecahedron", as such, which gives special attention to the 20 yellows and 12 reds over the blues, I prefer to think of this fully symmetrically, as the (2, 3, 5) triangle group (illustrated via dual of triangular tiling).

Text: @BlueyMcPhluey That is, this is the unique arrangement you get by following the rules that no two tiles of the same color touch, but for each color of tile, there is a specific number of times that it must touch each other color of tile: 2 for blue, 3 for yellow, 5 for red.

Text: @BlueyMcPhluey What's lovely is how this leads to the whole thing wrapping up finitely of its own accord (in this pic, growing out following our rules from the central red tile, we eventually culminate in the red "background" tile, which does indeed touch each other color 5 times at the end).

Text: @BlueyMcPhluey We could play with the number of times with which each color must touch other colors, but the only other numbers that lead to finitely wrapping up are (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 3), (2, 2, n) for arbitrary n ≥ 2, and also, a kind of degenerate (1, n, n) case.

Text: @BlueyMcPhluey Apart from that last one, these correspond to the Platonic solids: (2 3 5) to the dodecahedron and icosahedron, (2 3 4) to the cube and octahedron, (2 3 3) to the tetrahedron, and (2 2 n) to the (oft-ignored, slightly degenerate in their own way) dihedra and hosohedra.

Text: @BlueyMcPhluey I should include more pictures to illustrate what I'm saying. Anyway, Twitter is the worst for discussing math and I suspect no one can follow me who hasn't already thought about this anyway.
