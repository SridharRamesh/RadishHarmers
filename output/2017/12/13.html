Text: @zedtivx This is what people say, and fair enough, but it's always incredible to me that it's possible. One might imagine it not being quite possible to pick policy positions that'd carve the space of demographics up this way, and yet, incredibly, it turns out it is.

Text: @zedtivx Besides, also, just because there are two parties doesn't mean they'll strike a 50-50 balance naturally. One might be much better than the other. On purely powerholding grounds, each seeks a 100-0 balance in their favor, after all; each wants every demographic, if it can have it.

Text: In 4th grade, I went to my elementary school library to find a book on "algebra", this higher math topic I'd heard of but of which I had no idea what it was. The book I got ended up being about abstract algebra (?!!), but I didn't realize that distinction till years later.
