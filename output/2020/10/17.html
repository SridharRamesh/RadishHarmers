Text: When I heard the news that Wittgenstein had died, I was shocked. "How can this be? Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death", I cried. I had to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure myself that what it said was true.

Text: @sigfpe Basically every pathological monster concerning differentiability is only because we've picked a bad default meaning for "differentiable", which is to say, for "derivative". We should take the derivative of f at x to be the limit of (f(a) - f(b))/(a - b) as (a, b) goes to (x, x).
