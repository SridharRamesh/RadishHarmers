Text: I have unjustifiable distaste for all the stars of TikTok, YouTube, etc. They're just making jokes and doing the work, filming themselves, etc. But I'm too old. Their world is inaccessible to me. And their stylistic choices put their comedy at a pitch my adult ears cannot hear.

Bob would often come home from middle school with tears after being bullied with taunts of "Saget the Faggot". Homophobic much, Bob?

Nowadays the whole world is nothing but wounded sensitivity, so it's more trite in retrospect, but at the time it was some fresh air.
