Text: Everything feels disgusting when I'm sick. Food, weather, even abstract concepts turn my stomach when sick. Parsimony? No thank you. Grimm's Law? Nauseating. A rectangle twice as wide as it is tall? Ugh, could the world not, I'm trying to get better over here.

Text: Good news. The latest research out of the CDC indicates the virus cannot infect those who've never erred. It can only enter through small pores created by one's first mistake or sin; "popping the regret cherry" they call it. This should bring the rate of spread down considerably.

Text: @rahuldphys My concern was that "forge" can also mean "make", hence the re-wording. However, if you check the archives, you will find the original preserved as well, for historians of literature to compare and contrast.

Text: 1. Pondering how there are surely people who used to like me, then got to know me better or heard me talk more, and now no longer like me so much. Horrifying. But nothing is guaranteed to us forever.

2. The best Human Giant sketch is the one about the foley artist. Brilliant.
