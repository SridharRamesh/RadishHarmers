<pre>@bridgietherease Yeah. I mean, suburban NJ is less dense than Manhattan, but not worlds apart; half the people there commuted here every day for work up until just now. But it&#39;s true living in a house in the suburbs is different than living in an apartment building in the city, perhaps.</pre>

<pre>@bridgietherease They want to drive over to pick me up (not taking any trains), but I feel like that&#39;s probably still going to be a possibility for a while; even the shelter-in-place orders in the Bay Area, etc, haven&#39;t closed highways, have they?</pre>

<pre>@bridgietherease And I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll need me unless things get so bad that suddenly they themselves are sick. But who knows? But I also am very paranoid of being the person to get them sick. I don&#39;t know. Obviously, I love my parents and it&#39;s sweet they love me and are so worried about me.</pre>

<pre>(Not that this part matters, but finishing my abandoned thesis for personal closure is not a wild idea, but certainly isn&#39;t going to happen right now during these conditions. Being shut in without normal socialization release is ùëöùëúùëüùëí distracting than just having normal life.)</pre>

<pre>I can&#39;t gauge the right level of concerned to be. At first I wasn&#39;t worried, and didn&#39;t change any habits, then I came to feel that was foolish. Now I&#39;m much more worried, and rigorously quarantining, but given how many people I see walking around, maybe that&#39;s foolish.</pre>
