<pre>If I&#39;m going to know the minutiae of other people&#39;s lives, then the world needs to know the minutiae of mine. That&#39;s the balance of trade I operate under.</pre>

<pre>@pleyel1848 The smartest thing I ever did was set up automatic backups of my computer daily with Backblaze in &quot;the cloud&quot; (and also with an AirPort locally). It&#39;s saved my ass twice now.</pre>

<pre>I have a lot of trite thoughts, because I am human and thus similar to every human who has ever lived, of which there have been a significant number.</pre>

<pre>An apology is an impossible ritual we pretend people are extra remiss for falling short of.

There is no apology anyone can ever make for anything that will not be considered a non-apology. There are no non-non-apologies.</pre>
