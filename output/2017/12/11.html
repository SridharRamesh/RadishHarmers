Text: A lot of people are firmly convinced Hindu swastikas turn oppositely from Nazi ones, in accordance with some traditional good/bad distinction (Nazis in full-on "Are we the baddies?" mode…), when two seconds of Google Image Search shows this to be manifestly overwhelmingly false.

Text: I would never eat a fruit without washing it first; the ritual was firmly ingrained in childhood. Not an even an orange. Not even a banana. If you hand me an unwashed fruit to eat, I will slap that shit to the ground like it's arsenic.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law "swastika" and "sauwastika", yes. So people say. It's not clear to me that "sauwastika" is a traditional Hindu term for the counterclockwise swastika at all; this seems to have been made up by Eugène Burnouf.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law Yeah, but even the Buddhists don't consider one the "good" swastika and the other the "bad" swastika, right? That seems to be a key component of this urban legend (which is also bizarrely often stated as though the Nazi swastika turns oppositely from how it actually does…).

Text: The saddest thing about Cat Person for me is that, Internet fame being as it is, it will be ancient obscurity in four months. You think you've made it when you've gone so viral, and then it turns out, nah, fate remains capricious.
