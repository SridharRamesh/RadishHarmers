Text: @x1yeons You're watching edited footage where they messed with the speed for comedic effect. Of course it looks fake. When you take real videos and then make them fake, they look fake. https://t.co/fGNDPcBGWG

Text: @SmilingObject @brogadishu I'm reminded of a West Wing line stuck in my head still. A salt of the Earth sap pouring out "It should be hard. I like that it's hard. Putting your daughter through college, that's a man's job. A man's accomplishment.", as he stirringly requests only incremental tuition relief.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law I started reading more of this person's posts and, damn. That is pretty insulting of Facebook to do. If only they'd had the respect to use a traditional Indian symbol. https://t.co/R9PRfwKb3t

Text: @edavidds @SmilingObject @brogadishu The world is currently set up around employment. It is rare for one to be able to live without it. Thus, currently, contingently, social structures and stigmas track this. Every study of this sort is tainted by this. It does not tell us what the world not set up this way is like.

Text: @rogerbellin For what it's worth, although I may be misreading what they're saying, I don't think it's weird for a lawyer to reference Clarence Darrow in 1969, even if there weren't two relatively recent screen adaptations of Inherit The Wind. Even in the past, people remembered the past.

Text: The quote tweet maybe situates some of these comments as though "dunks", when I don't really have that intention. Ah, I don't know. I just felt like remarking on the phenomenon where nitpick-threads are themselves often susceptible to nitpick, by the same uncharitable standards.

Text: People I trust are happy about Bolivia, so I'm happy. I don't really know the details beyond that. I'd be lying if I claimed to. I'm not really an expert on socialist geopolitics or history. Sorry to shatter the illusion. I have other expertises.

Text: In half of contexts, I feel expertise is all made-up credentials, naive saps swallowing whatever authority says. And on the other half of topics, I am upset oppositely, everyone opining dumbly without having learnt 101. Just another of the many fun ways in which I am a hypocrite.

Text: Who would I describe as my influences? Oh, a variety of figures across various fields. Math, entertainment, political movements. I'll just name a few: Alan Turing, Ernest Hemingway, Abbie Hoffman, C. P. Ramanujam, Phil Ochs, Ludwig Boltzmann, Mark Rothko, and Hunter S. Thompson.

Text: @rogerbellin We got blocked, which is certainly his prerogative. I'm sure it came across as unusually aggressive or unduly rude of me to quote tweet, the dynamics of talking about strangers' talking online are tricky. https://t.co/GoNWZFKedU
