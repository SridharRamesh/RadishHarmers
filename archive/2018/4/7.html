<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I hate when comics tell stories about some funny thing they saw somebody else do, when clearly the other person patronized in the anecdote was _intentionally_ being funny. That joke belongs to the other person. You&#39;ve done nothing here; you&#39;re just a transmission medium, a VCR.</p></blockquote>

Oh, wow, you own a red pen.</p></blockquote>
