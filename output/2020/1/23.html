Text: In classrooms all over, teachers engage in shockingly insensitive behavior, instructing students to disregard the order in which values are combined (indeed, drilling "(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab" and the like). So many disheartening examples of institutionalized Abelism.

Text: Oh, the other boys used to tease me so for burning my tongue on hot dosa in middle school. Jeering, they ate their dosas cold, the white American way. I begged my Amma to let me eat the "cool" way, but only later realized how this must have hurt her; the pain of 1,00,000 dosas.
