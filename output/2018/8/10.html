Text: Democratic socialism is racist, as majorities might vote to oppress minorities. As a SOCIAL system, its "democracy" is simple majority-wins-all votes. Democratic capitalism, on the other hand, is A-ok, as its second word assures us it's a CAPITAL idea; the good kind of democracy.

Text: This one man still exists. He has spent days staring at that same page, trying desperately to sound out the words.

So please: do not be one of the careless many gazing at phones on the subway. Such literacy-flaunting can be cruelly embarrassing to others. https://t.co/69PWchC6aN

Text: @sheckyyoungman The Unabomber is pretty illustrative of another oft-overlooked point: you can be really genuinely good at math (or whatever), and it doesn't mean shit, in terms of your general reasoning and how much deference others should give it.

Text: Whether you're a left-winger or a right-winger, here's an illustrative exercise that works for EVERYONE:

Name any big name politician you hate, a real dogshit-for-brains.

Text: This did not take off, and that's ok; it's ephemeral Twitter fluff. (I ought only be making posts with some lasting value outside of responding to other insular Twitter nonsense; tweets that aren't about tweeting.) However, I remain pleased by it because of timestamp coincidence.
