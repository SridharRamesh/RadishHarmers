<pre>@ModelOfTheory Inversion in the sense of negation? But why focus on 2-ary inversion, and not 3-ary inversion (where a, wa, and w^2a are considered a triple of 3-ary inverses, for w a primitive 3rd root of unity), or whatever n-ary thing. Perhaps this is circular too…</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby Sure, one could imagine a framework in which we postulated some first (or otherwise canonical) transfinitely far digit after all the finitely far ones, such that something like this is to happen. But that&#39;s not the framework I intend to be describing.</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby It&#39;s a different framework than the familiar one, and in considering whether its outcomes &quot;make sense&quot;, one oughtn&#39;t interpret those results in the familiar way. Its outcomes make perfect sense on their own terms.</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby As I said, it&#39;s used to study cyclic phenomena; e.g., in considering angles, it is indeed the case that making lots of turns in one direction is eventually as good as turning the other way. In such contexts, it&#39;s very sensible to take a large sum of positives to equal a negative.</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby Not to mention (again much like with negatives or fractions) there are many results about plain-ordinary arithmetic which are most easily seen by going through intermediary thoughts from the perspective of 10-adic arithmetic. Everything&#39;s connected.</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory A group being a monoid with a function f such that f^2(x) = x and x * f(x) = 1.

But similarly, we may consider &quot;troupes&quot;, a troupe being a monoid with an f such that f^3(x) = x and x * f(x) * f^2(x) = 1. (And so on for any n, naturally).</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory So might we (I am genuinely pondering this) consider focus on groups instead of n-troupes similarly a circular sneaking in of fake specialness of 2?</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory Tangentially, I&#39;ve often been curious when and by who in history the realization that permutations carry parity was first discovered. I&#39;d usually attributed it to Cauchy in the 1810s, but it seems at least implicit in Cramer&#39;s discussion of his eponymous rule 70 years earlier.</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory Yes, but what is an automorphism group? A collection of endomorphism tuples (m_1, m_2) such that m_1 * m_2 = m_2 * m_1 = 1, composing under the rule (m_1, m_2) * (n_1, n_2) = (m_1 * n_1, n_2 * m_2).

But perhaps a 2 has been snuck in here implicitly…</pre>

<p>
<pre>@ModelOfTheory In non-abelian context, it&#39;s tricky to see what an automorphism troupe should be, but in a context where everything commutes, we might consider an automorphism troupe to be a collection of triples (m_1, m_2, m_3) satisfying m_1 * m_2 * m_3 = 1, composing component-wise.</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory The specialness of 2 might then be that we could make sense of this even without requiring everything to commute, but 2 wouldn&#39;t quite get specialness over the concept entirely.</pre>

<pre>@Subb4k @ModelOfTheory This generalizes: Any field of characteristic p has its p-th roots of unity (in its algebraic closure) all equal. (But the fact that every field already contains -1 without need for further closure is precisely the fact that the 2nd primitive root of unity is already an integer.)</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory Alright, now the 2 comes from your focus on &quot;functions&quot;; that is, on particular 2-ary relations. But we might also look at 3-ary correspondence relations. E.g., R(x, y, z), such that for any choice of x, y, or z, there are designated corresponding values for the other arguments.</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory Note that we can compose these 3-ary correspondences in the various ways that 3-simplices can be put together to make new 3-simplices, just as we could compose our familiar 2-ary correspondences in the various ways that 2-simplices can be put together to make new 2-simplicies.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@ModelOfTheory Of course, there&#39;s a simplicity to 2, which wanes with higher n. This is the fact that 2 is smaller than higher n. 2 is special in being minimal among the cardinals bigger than 1, yes…</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory Er, I&#39;ve gotten my indexing on simplices off by one from how people normally index them, but you see what I mean. I&#39;ve been saying &quot;n-simplex&quot; for &quot;simplex with n points&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory Put another way, an isomorphism groupoid, like any groupoid, can be just as well viewed simplicially. And so a group, traditionally thought of only in terms of the 1-cells (2-point simplices) of a fixed object, just as well gives rise to n-simplices for all n.</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory The 2-simplices come with 2-ary inversion (like turning a line around); the 3-ary simplices come with 3-ary rotations and reflections (like turning or flipping a triangle); the 4-ary simplices come with all the permutations of a tetrahedron, etc.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@ModelOfTheory It&#39;s only for simplicity and minimalism that we choose to focus on the 2-ary structure primarily (in terms of which everything else can be described, yes, just as n-ary compositions can be described via 2-ary ones, but which needn&#39;t be considered the exclusive presentation…).</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory You can alternatively phrase this in 2-ish ways if you like, but you can phrase anything in lots of ways. It&#39;s not fundamentally a 2-ish notion, except in that each 3-point simplex contains within it 2-simplices for its sides, and so on.</pre>
