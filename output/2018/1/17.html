Text: Colma and SoMa are homophonous. The "C" is pronounced like in "celery", and the "lm" is pronounced like in "palm". (The "l" is not pronounced like in "celery".)

Text: @Styl_oh @naptimecomedy @SFSketchfest Ah, no, no, I'll be sincere for a moment: there's no time limit (and of course the Funny Or Die police won't show up at my house to murder me in keeping with their title). Also, FOD doesn't really matter at all. I'm just typing inanities into the Internet that sometimes amuse me.
