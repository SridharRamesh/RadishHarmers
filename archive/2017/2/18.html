<pre>@tanisthemanis 4) + 5) almost exactly analogous to Obama in 2012 saying &quot;Russia, don&#39;t overreact; we&#39;ll work it out&quot; https://t.co/2GhwsT7yJ1</pre>

<pre>@tanisthemanis Which is fine, but on a factual level, no, Trump and Putin didn&#39;t arrange a deal, and Putin isn&#39;t pulling Trump&#39;s strings.</pre>

<pre>@tanisthemanis But I won&#39;t convince you and you won&#39;t me, so let&#39;s leave it at that and let the future hopefully resolve the answer clearly.</pre>

<pre>@kathbarbadoro Someone asked the author about this. Apparently, NYT style guide demands microphone be abbreviated &quot;mike&quot;, old-fashionedly.</pre>

<pre>@kathbarbadoro I think the biggest problem with the article is that it doesn&#39;t say very much. &quot;Open mics are hard and not very attentive&quot;.</pre>
