<pre>Hahaha. &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. Ahahaha. To be clear, what I am laughing at is only the latter part of the term; the former brings me no mirth, it is simply another valid way for a person to be, we are all children of God.</pre>

<pre>Telling stories at the party, namedropping. Mostly namedropping kids from my high school. They didn&#39;t go on to anything notable, but man, they had some great names. Come to think of it, a lot of these names are just urban legends, and kinda racist. I hope I meet a celeb someday.</pre>

<pre>The secret to a dashing smile is working all your stress out each night and morning, exercised and thus exorcised via violent jabs of the toothbrush, sawing all that frustration against the gums, leading them to recede, thereby exposing more of the brilliant white of the teeth.</pre>

<pre>So then I said to Wilde, &quot;You will, Oscar, you will…&quot;. It was very witty, and again, just to be clear, I, Sridhar Ramesh, was the one who said it.</pre>
