<pre>@bridgietherease Welcome back! Sorry to hear you&#39;ve been having a rough time, and I hope things are better or at least getting better now.</pre>

<pre>I haven&#39;t had a hangover in six years: 1997, 2003, 2006, I think 2011… This tweet is a lie, I largely quit drinking when I was 24, but I couldn&#39;t think of a better frame for delivering this wordplay mechanic. The joke still stands. It&#39;d sell like hotcakes in bumper sticker form.</pre>

<pre>Would&#39;ve been a coin flip which sex got all world power, but men have more upper body strength and are a bit taller on average, so it went to them. Eons ago, it was settled on the savanna, and thus still today, the significance of reaching the high shelf and opening tighter jars.</pre>

<pre>Everyone poor, everyone suffering, deserves amends up to a high quality of life. They needn&#39;t have had any particular offense committed against them or their family to qualify. Poverty is the offense. Suffering is the offense.</pre>

<pre>Waitaminute. College sucked. I only tried to convince myself otherwise because a bunch of guys from the &#39;70s (who went to college in the &#39;60s) spent their adult lives churning out movies like Animal House.</pre>

<pre>My pal with the greatest romantic luck told me he generically first-messages on Tinder with &quot;I have something urgent to ask you!&quot;, thus successfully sparking reply and conversation, and now I hate all modern courtship rituals. I can&#39;t be pursuing my love life like a 419 scammer.</pre>

<pre>At a hair salon, each different stylist wears a very distinctive, outrageous, idiosyncratic style of haircut, and each is attending to a customer who they are giving the same distinctive, idiosyncratic style of haircut. Draw it up and make it a New Yorker cartoon.</pre>

<pre>Let f_N = (d/dx)^N cos(x^½). Note f_N = P(y)f_0 + Q(y)f_1 for y = 1/(4x); P, Q integer polys of deg O(N). But |f_N(x)| ~ N!/(2N)! as N → ∞. Given this super-exponential decay, set x^½ = π to conclude 1/π^2 irrational (more generally, tan(z)/z rational ⇒ 1/z^2 irrational). QED.</pre>
