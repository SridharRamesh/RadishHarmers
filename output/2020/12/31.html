Text: @turtlekiosk I see. I have been unclear. It is not that my dad and mom disagree about which one loves the other more. Rather, the point of disagreement is that my dad believes my mom is the greatest, but my mom believes my dad is the greatest. The grass is always greener on the other side.

Text: @spacefracking @hailgribble You may be surprised to hear that I am not a covid denier and am just curious how much pandemic measures have also ended up reducing other common disease. Just reflecting on the fact that I normally get so many colds a year and got none this year. Just idle chit-chat curiosity.

Text: I'm not one of those fools who assumes that just because I live in 2020, therefore 2020 is now. In 1880 they thought 1880 was now, and 1600 in 1600, and so on, all wrong. I've got a feeling we're getting close, though. I bet now lies within the century. And here somewhere nearby.
