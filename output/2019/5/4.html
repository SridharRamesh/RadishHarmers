Text: @Dabbie_Hoffman God, what is with congressional representatives hooking up with bin raccoons? Some kind of inferiority complex over not being senators?

Text: @Sturgeons_Law @dignified_n_old @_curlytrill The probability distribution for the accuracy of a sample of N independently random people out of a population of size P depends solely on N and the actual fraction of the actual population who'd answer each way, but doesn't at all depend on P, or on how large N is compared to P.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law @dignified_n_old @_curlytrill But one might doubt the randomness of the sample selection process, or the significance of the answers provided to the questions as worded, or such things.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law @dignified_n_old @_curlytrill Sure. Bigger is always better. I shouldn't really say "extremely representative", but it's representative enough. I mean, these kinda polls are all flawed, they have myriad failures to correspond to ultimate vote tallies, and we saw the failure of trusting them too much in 2016.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law @dignified_n_old @_curlytrill But as a mathematician, it irks whenever I see people appearing to say that it's important that the sample size be large in proportion to the population, when the population size completely doesn't matter (for the probability distribution of the results of independent samples).

Text: @ebarcuzzi @Sturgeons_Law @dignified_n_old @_curlytrill These kinds of probabilities are meaningless. Sam Wang called the election a 99% probability win for Clinton at one point. What is the actionable value in this kind of forecasting if even saying something like that shouldn't be interpreted as a failed prediction?

Text: @ebarcuzzi @Sturgeons_Law @dignified_n_old @_curlytrill In the polling problem, there is a clear frequentist interpretation to the probability distribution over random samples and the probability numbers one might thus discuss. (They're all a little backwards from what one really cares about, but they at least have a real meaning.)

Text: @ebarcuzzi @Sturgeons_Law @dignified_n_old @_curlytrill But in the actual election prediction problem (which is not the mathematical question of how many samples of a population are how close in their statistics to the population, but rather the prediction of how people's feelings will change over time as unknown events unfold),

Text: @ebarcuzzi @Sturgeons_Law @dignified_n_old @_curlytrill all the Bayesian probability distributions people produce have unclear, I daresay meaningless, interpretations.

I say it's all nonsense, and there is genuine Knightian uncertainty in election predicting which can't be waved away by invoking numbers and alleged math magic.

Text: The comments keep saying this would've been easy to do because of all the green. How's that useful? The dog wasn't green. How'd they remove it so perfectly, even as it moved across many also non-green things? Shrek is green. Does that help? Is green magic? https://t.co/3wfw66jGJq

Text: @delmoi Yeah, exactly. I feel like the "green screen" terminology has made people overly fixated on the green. Though I'll grant there's a large block of largely constant color, but again, I don't see how that solves the tricky problems.
