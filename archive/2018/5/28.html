<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Folks are always saying shit like &quot;conservation of momentum is just logically equivalent to the invariance of physical laws under spatial translation. Surely you don&#39;t think physics is different from place to place, do you?&quot;, which irksomely overstates the matter.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These Noetherean equivalences only hold under the presumption of a Lagrangian framework in the first place. Nothing logically forces physics to follow Lagrangian mechanics, except that it happens to be empirically observed to.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">But the people you are attempting to put in their place by baldly stating these putative equivalences aren&#39;t familiar with Lagrangian mechanics, and aren&#39;t presuming it, and would be perfectly happy to consider the possibility of physics of a different sort.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Indeed, the very fact that any idiot can easily imagine spatially homogenous physics without conservation of momentum (e.g., as in various Mario games) makes your argument seem laughably fallacious to those who haven&#39;t already been trained to recognize it as merely enthymematic.</p></blockquote>
