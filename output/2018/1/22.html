Text: Aw, you got me! You predicted aloud that I would do a thing in a situation, and then I came along and did just that very thing! Good job catching me out on, uh, having a consistent personality and not, er, choosing all actions via coin flips and die rolls.

Text: Folks eat up that rollercoaster and bungee shit, but as a rule, I don't enjoy any activity where the alleged thrill is that your body yells the whole time "WHOA THIS ISN'T WHAT I WAS MADE FOR OH NO". I tend to be on the same page as my body. I tend to feel a kinship with my body.
