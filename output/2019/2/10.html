Text: A habit I used to have till online broke my brain was, when encountering someone whose position wasn't the same as mine, on stuff that doesn't matter, just, reacting by saying things we'd both agree with or nearly so, and staying quiet about whatever else. It was fun and amiable.

Text: Tuition is made up. It's all a scam. It doesn't nearly cost that much to run lectures and discussion sections; very little of that goes to the professors and TAs doing the teaching. It's within living memory to not be this way, yet now Serious People talk of it as pie-in-the-sky.

Text: I mean, the ostensible teaching is also in many cases a sham, an empty credentialing ritual no actor in the process really cares about at more than a cargo cult level. And the scarcity model for college admissions is a con, and so on. Everything's designed grotesquely, a set-up.

Text: I think the nature of it is, people largely say things they don't believe in comedy, as comedy very much is not about truth. And in seeking new things to say, they sometimes land on dumb shit way off the mark. But they don't believe it, and ideally soon realize to drop saying it.
