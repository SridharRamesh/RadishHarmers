<pre>@christapeterso @beingandslime There are 5 classes of note. Consider: I, me, my, mine, myself. He, him, his, his, himself.

It&#39;s easy to imagine the last one is simply determined by the third, or by the second, but it is not, because it is sometimes the third and sometimes the second.</pre>

<pre>Used to be if a tweet caught the corner of your eye just as you scrolled a tad or refreshed the TL, you could at least Ctrl+F some relevant words and find it again (on desktop). This no longer works, with whatever they&#39;ve changed to their implementation of infinite scrolling.</pre>

<pre>@MattWatchGundam This is ambiguous, that&#39;s all. It&#39;s just ambiguous notation; it has nothing to do with math, really, just notation, language, conventions, etc. Not that any mathematician ever normally writes division this way anyway.

See https://t.co/KpDVBXLSjE.</pre>

<pre>@MattWatchGundam In the specifics, you could interpret this to mean &quot;Multiply 2 by (2 + 2), then divide 8 by that result&quot;. This of course comes out to 1.

Or you could interpret this to mean &quot;Divide 8 by 2, then multiply that result by (2 + 2)&quot;. This of course comes out to 16.</pre>

<pre>@MattWatchGundam Which one was meant? Who knows? Not every sentence is unambiguous. This is true in ordinary natural language and it&#39;s true here too. Communicating math is not something different from ordinary language. Sometimes people write ambiguous things and must clarify what they mean.</pre>

<pre>@delmoi @pjmdolI This is mentioned in the above screenshot, yes. I mean, the problem is ultimately that it&#39;s ambiguous, that&#39;s all. Mathematicians don&#39;t actually talk like this, so there&#39;s no real convention for how to interpret this. (All only notation, of course. Un-ideal notation, at that.)</pre>
