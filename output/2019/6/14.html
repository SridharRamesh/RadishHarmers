Text: @NewTmrw @yeetphilosopher You mean e^(iÏ€) + 1 = 0. Off the top of my head, I don't see a good b-adic interpretation of Ï€.

I'll note though that i = sqrt(-1) can be interpreted b-adically for those b whose factors are all 1 mod 4, without having to add it in extra. For example, in base 5, â€¦31212^2 = -1.

Text: @NewTmrw @yeetphilosopher We could also study the behavior of e^(ix) b-adically in general. This will only converge for suitable x, but that's fine. Using this, we can define cos and sin as even and odd components, and we have the usual trig laws for addition, etc. We won't have Ï€ for periodicity, though!

Text: @NewTmrw @foolinthelotus @yeetphilosopher @haramgirlfriend Sure, you can do that. That's the 16-adics. Note that this is essentially the same as the b-adics for any power of 2 base.

Text: @NewTmrw @foolinthelotus @yeetphilosopher @haramgirlfriend Note also, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, 10-adic arithmetic decomposes as a combination of 2-adic (equivalently, hexadecimal-adic) and 5-adic arithmetic. A 10-adic number can be seen as a pair of a 2-adic and a 5-adic number, and all arithmetic just works on these separately.

Text: @TheHyyyype It also has almost nothing to do with the relative proportion of two numbers. A 100 : 200 Like-to-Reply ratio is huge, a 1 : 2 ratio is nothing.
