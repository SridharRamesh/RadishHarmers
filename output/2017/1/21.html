Text: @zandywithaz (And, in case it isn't clear, it's funny because it's such a perfectly understandable screw-up anyone could make, so minor and un-damning)

Text: @sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes Yeah, I'd read that, and saw the Steve Harvey thing, but didn't even put those together with this tweet somehow, haha.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes The specific context is just a re-illustration of how the general context is. Both Harvey and Huang just echoing many other conversations.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes The de-masculinization of Asian men is real, we can surely all agree, and deserves pushback, just like any other racial stereotyping.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes We may be inclined to consider it diff-ly in a dating context cuz consent issues: of course anyone may couple or not w/ whoever they choose.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes But people do not make their decisions in a vacuum; they are influenced by imagery and narratives around them.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes And those narratives ought be changed, again just as for any racial stereotyping situation. Race oughtn't cause such disparate experiences.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes There are associated "backlash" issues, as noted in the thread linked to in the original tweet: e.g., Asian guys fixating on white women.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes (Just as, statistically, everyone in our stupid culture does). They shouldn't do that either. Same dumb problem, on the flipside.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes But that doesn't mean it's wrong for Asian men to worry about their demasculinized general cultural image. Anyway, I've written too much.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 @TommSciortino @nytimes (One problem w/ complaining about such demasculinization as an Asian guy is it just continues feeding into an uncool image; a real catch-22)
