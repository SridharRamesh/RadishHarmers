<pre>The jerk store called, and they will no longer be needing my services. Right before Christmas. How could they do this to me, so callously?</pre>

<pre>I love talking to the elderly about their regrets. They enjoy the opportunity to vent too. I imagine in these moments how I am learning to avoid the same mistakes, but then it turns out forces are in effect that lead many humans to similar lives, outside their desires or control.</pre>

<pre>My two children come crying to me, each accusing me of liking the other more. I explain tenderly to them that this is like wondering whether I love my left or my right eye more. Eventually, with a hug and a kiss for each, they are calmed. As I leave, I wink at my favorite.</pre>

<pre>Models should never be good looking people. When I see a good looking person showing off clothes or accessories, I discount the results entirely. Tremendously uninformative. The best models are real uggos, used to illustrate the Δ, in before and after displays.</pre>
