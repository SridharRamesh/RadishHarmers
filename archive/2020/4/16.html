<pre>Let ζ(-p) = 1^p + 2^p + 3^p + … be the Riemann zeta function. This converges when the real component of p is &amp;lt; -1. How do we make sense of this for general powers p?</pre>

<pre>Everyone talks about the Riemann zeta function like it&#39;s tricky to construct and requires thinking about the sophisticated machinery of meromorphic continuation. It&#39;s not and it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s much simpler than that.</pre>

<pre>Another notation for the same thing is that S&#39;(x) = f&#39;(x) + f&#39;(x + 1) + f&#39;(x + 2) + … may well converge for all x, even if S(x) itself doesn&#39;t.

This derivative tells us a lot! Integrating its derivative tells us everything about what S should be, except for an unknown +C term.</pre>

<pre>Let&#39;s give this a nice name as a function: S(x) = f(x) + f(x + 1) + f(x + 2) + ….

And note that S(a) - S(b) should be [f(a) - f(b)] + [f(a + 1) - f(b + 1)] + [f(a + 2) - f(b + 2)] + …, which may converge even if neither S(a) nor S(b) converge in themselves.</pre>

<pre>Well, let&#39;s consider a more general problem. Things are often simpler in greater abstraction, at least to my mindset. Suppose you want to make sense of f(x) + f(x + 1) + f(x + 2) + … in general, even though this may not converge. What can you do?</pre>

<pre>In other words, so long as some number of differentiations makes it converge, we know what f(x) + f(x + 1) + f(x + 2) + … should be, up to a polynomial term.

But how do we figure out what the +Cs in the integrations should be taken to be?</pre>

<pre>In the same way, we could take 2nd or higher derivatives. So even if the first derivative doesn&#39;t make it converge, so long as SOME higher derivative converges, we can recover f(x) + f(x + 1) + f(x + 2) + … by repeated integration, once we know which +Cs to pick at each step.</pre>

<pre>[Technically, it sums to -G(b) + G(b + ∞) in a limiting sense, but if it were true that G(x) + G(x + 1) + G(x + 2) + … converged, then it would have to be true that G approaches 0 in the limit anyway.]</pre>

<pre>Well, let&#39;s make one more observation about the average values of these functions: Suppose g is the n-th derivative of f. What is the average value of g on an arbitrary unit interval [b, b + 1]? I.e., what should the integral of g from b to b + 1 be?</pre>

<pre>One subtlety is that, in the last integration to get f(x) + f(x + 1) + f(x + 2) + …, this will require us to evaluate the -1-th derivative of f; that is, we can only carry out this technique after we&#39;ve already settled on a choice of antiderivative for f itself. But that&#39;s fine.</pre>

<pre>What our above reasoning implicitly shows is that our technique for defining F&#39;(x) + F&#39;(x + 1) + F&#39;(x + 2) + … gives the unique pseudopolynomial function whose average value on each [b, b + 1] is -F(b) [with this existing if and only if F itself is pseudopolynomial].</pre>

<pre>In this way, we can evaluate x^p + (x + 1)^p + (x + 2)^p + … for general p [this is called the Hurwitz zeta function, ζ(-p, x)] and by using the specific value x = 1, we get the Riemann zeta function.</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>Having done so, we can use the technique above. Sufficiently many differentiations will indeed make this into something convergent, since each differentiation brings the power down by 1 and we get convergence once the real component of the power is &amp;lt; -1.</pre>

<p>
<pre>Now we need to pick an antiderivative for f. Specifically, an antiderivative which approaches 0 when f(x) + f(x + 1) + f(x + 2) + … is already convergent and that extends this in a clean pattern more generally. The natural choice is to use the antiderivative x^(p + 1)/(p + 1).</pre>

<pre>For example, the question is often posed of how to generalize the factorial to non-integer arguments.

Well, the defining property of the factorial is that x! = x * (x - 1)!. In other words, log(x!) = log(x) + log((x - 1)!).</pre>

<pre>That&#39;s it. It&#39;s that simple. This defines the zeta function on arbitrary inputs. No need to think about meromorphic continuation. Just differentiation till you hit convergence, and integration back up with the right choice of constants to get the right average values.</pre>

<p>
<pre>Well, there&#39;s one hitch: when p = -1, our antiderivative x^(p + 1)/(p + 1) involves a division by zero. And this is why the zeta function has a pole at the power -1 (i.e., at the harmonic series).

At every other power, everything works out smoothly, to some finite number.</pre>

<pre>Note that, with two differentiations, log(x) turns into 1/x^2, which does indeed have the property that 1/x^2 + 1/(x + 1)^2 + 1/(x + 2)^2 + … converges. [Note also that this is just another instance of the Hurwitz zeta function!]</pre>

<pre>For what it&#39;s worth, this generalized factorial is what people often call the &quot;gamma function&quot;, but this different name (and also the slight re-indexing people use for it) is a dumb hidebound thing that you need pay no attention to. Just call it the factorial like usual.</pre>

<pre>So our technique will find the unique pseudopolynomial fit to be the derivative of the logarithmic factorial. Given this and the starting value 0! = 1, we&#39;ve defined the factorial itself, now generalized to arbitrary inputs. And we even see its relation to the zeta functions!</pre>

<pre>@joe_moviegoer You still have convergence in the same cases [define g(x) as f(Tx), and then observe that g(x/T) + g(x/T + 1) + g(x/T + 2) = f(x) + f(x + T) + f(x + 2T)…, with analogous equations on the higher derivative series up to a multiplicative constant].</pre>

<pre>@joe_moviegoer For the zeta functions in particular, note that (Tx)^p = T^p x^p, so the result is just a simple reparametrization and rescaling. That is, x^p + (x + T)^p + (x + 2T)^p + … = T^p ( (x/T)^p + (x/T + 1)^p + (x/T + 2)^p + …) = T^p ζ(-p, x/T).</pre>

<pre>@wokeberia No. b through b + 1 here are not inputs to the Riemann zeta function; they do not serve as values for p in 1^p + 2^p + 3^p + …. They serve as values of x in S(x) = x^p + (x + 1)^p + (x + 2)^p + ….</pre>

<pre>@wokeberia And we are talking about a situation where we already know what S(x) is everywhere up to a constant, and are now trying to determine the value of that constant using the also known value of the integral of S(x) dx as x runs from b to b + 1.</pre>

<pre>@wokeberia This is a completely different idea than extending the zeta function to general p by using analyticity. For one thing, I&#39;ve not even mentioned the concept of being differentiable or analytic with respect to the argument p.</pre>

<pre>@wokeberia You can run this argument without ever thinking about analyticity with respect to p, much less knowing about uniqueness of analytic continuation.</pre>

<pre>@wokeberia Another way to see this is different from analytic continuation is that this technique also immediately gave us the gamma function as the unique &quot;pseudopolynomial&quot; solution to its recurrence relation, something difficult to derive as a matter of unique analytic continuation.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@wokeberia And this can be explained by the fact that the result is complex-differentiable with respect to p, with derivative log(x) * x^p + log(x + 1) * (x + 1)^p + log(x + 2) * (x + 2)^p + …, which again can be summed for general p by the same technique.</pre>
