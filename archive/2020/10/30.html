<pre>In general, (A, B, C) wraps up finitely just in case 1/A + 1/B + 1/C &amp;gt; 1, by an argument I&#39;m afraid I will have to spell out some other time.</pre>

<pre>There&#39;s a few other triples of numbers one could use which make structures with the same property of wrapping up finitely of their own accord: (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 3), (2, 2, n) for any n, and in a certain degenerate sense (1, 1, n) for any n. That&#39;s it.</pre>

<pre>Each colored region borders each other color a fixed number of times (including the red background): Blue 2, Yellow 3, Red 5. This determines the entire structure, which wraps up finitely of its own accord. Increasing any of these three numbers would tip it into the infinite. https://t.co/dwcLSI6n80</pre>

<pre>But that&#39;s it, those are the only Platonic solids, by the 1/A + 1/B + 1/C story I&#39;ll have to tell some other time (when my laptop is fixed and I&#39;m not typing on my phone).

The story extends beautifully into higher dimensions and all sorts of other connections in math as well.</pre>

<pre>These are the five &quot;Platonic solids&quot;, the solid shapes with perfect symmetry so far as all their connectivity structure goes. (2, 2, n) corresponds to an n-sided polygon thought of as a solid with a front and back face, which is also just as symmetric.</pre>

<pre>In the same way, (2, 3, 4) corresponds to the the cube (4-sided faces, 3 at a point) and octahedron (3-sided faces, 4 to a point), and (2, 3, 3) corresponds to the tetrahedron (3-sided faces, 3 to a point).</pre>

<pre>But again, despite the intimidation of this having become a thread, the basic idea in my header image is simple. A child could understand it. Each colored region borders each other color a fixed number of times (including the red background): Blue 2, Yellow 3, Red 5.</pre>

<pre>@noahdmancino They&#39;re well understood by mathematicians at this point. We&#39;ve found all the cases where you get this finite wrapping from three colors with fixed numbers in this way, and we understand why. The rest of the thread describes a bit more, though not so much of the why as I&#39;d like.</pre>

<pre>@noahdmancino The latter, though this also implies the former. For example, sit down and try to work out (2, 3, 4) for yourself. You&#39;ll soon find that all decisions are forced. It&#39;s completely mechanical.</pre>

<pre>I should say, (2, 2, n) also corresponds to an n-faced &quot;hosohedron&quot;, which is basically a beach ball, a bunch of two-sided faces connected like a ring, all the faces meeting together at the top and bottom of the ball.</pre>

<pre>@alphonso__mango The correspondence is that if you color the vertices of a dodecahedron yellow, the edges blue, and the faces red, you get the same diagram (same in the sense of which colored regions connect in what way to which other colored regions; sizes and angles are irrelevant here).</pre>

<pre>@RevFoxinistSalt @cobrollins @potax @lumpensecretary He&#39;s being sarcastic. There are six historical figures at this table, and it happens to be the case that two of them were Jewish, but that&#39;s clearly not the salient point. The salient point is that they&#39;re famous &quot;robber baron&quot; rich guys (well, five robber barons and Crowley).</pre>

You have to actually understand what you&#39;re talking about. Going off vague &quot;It makes me feel bad&quot; impressions is the &quot;You hurt me in a dream&quot; logic I&#39;m talking about.</pre>
