<pre>@matthewaraven I have leaned in to my position as music hater philistine and am going forward with it with just the facts justification in a way roughly similar to how Matt Bruenig often talks about some other things that get him accused of philistinism, 7-11s or electric stoves or whatever.</pre>

<pre>@timmyj213 I had one haircut last summer and they seemed to handle it alright, so I&#39;d be happy to do that again, except for paranoia about the new more contagious strain, maybe it being stupid if we&#39;re near the end with vaccines, etc. But we&#39;re probably not really anywhere near the end yet.</pre>
