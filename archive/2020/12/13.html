<pre>Actually, that is a common misconception. It was my ardent debunking of the pseudoscience of astrology which earnt me the nickname &quot;The Zodiac Killer&quot;. My spree of unsolved murders in the San Francisco area in the late 60s and early 70s is unrelated.</pre>

<pre>There&#39;s also some more specific resemblance between Church, my advisor, and me in particularly spending time thinking about function types abstractly, but what I mean by this won&#39;t mean much to anyone who isn&#39;t me.</pre>

<pre>Of course there is a resemblance in that we were all concerned with foundational matters in logic, but that&#39;s just being in the same field. That&#39;s just being logicians.</pre>

<pre>It would be Alonzo Church (and thus Alan Turing would be my academic uncle), if I hadn&#39;t quit in the middle of writing my dissertation. I still fantasize of disciplinedly finishing it in time for this to count, but the clock keeps ticking. https://t.co/23DWKeWUPb</pre>

<pre>I don&#39;t know anything about the biz. Is residuals structure so different for theaters vs streaming? Sounds like that&#39;s the problem, then. Weird to frame the problem as that theaters might fall off and streaming rise up in a pandemic world, or any world where streaming exists. https://t.co/HYtzSmomD8</pre>
