Text: e^20 = ...27197858457785818756568221.0

Proof: check ln(this) = 20 by calculating (this^ε - 1)/ for ε ≈ 0; i.e., with many initial 0 digits.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 It's real math, but presented in a deliberately surprising &amp; coy way; thus perhaps amusing? A joke now, &amp; later just a fact.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 But, yes, understanding the backwards notation is a good start. Perhaps you've seen it noted before that ...999.0 = -1?

Text: @sqrtnegative1 That's right, but you may prefer to think in terms of rings of modular arithmetic.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 Specifically, consider the categorical limit of Z/10^nZ (with obvious quotient maps between these).

Text: @sqrtnegative1 Right. Great. Ok, so how might you notate a 10-adic value? A certain "backwards" notation seems apropos...

Text: How to talk to a girl with headphones on:
1) Wear headphones
2) Talk to a girl (presumably, one who isn't wearing headphones herself)

Easy!

Text: @RadishHarmers Argh, no Tweet editing. Should say "(this^ε - 1)/ε" for ln(this) calculation, of course.

Text: (Thus, e^100 = …27821900070921005101. Of course, more familiarly, e = 2.71828182846…

Some coincidence that these all look so similar.)
