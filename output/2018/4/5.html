Text: @neyvay I hope to God there is video of this somewhere to put the Vengaboys over.

(Also, WTF? This tweet is criminally underappreciated right now. I expect to see this rectified by the morning, Twitter.)

Text: The sex number? That's what I call condoms! Amirite, folks? Folks? Usually at this point in the tweet, something happens to cut me off, "This is a job interview", something, anything. How have I been left to carry on? Wait, how has my character limit extended?! Oh god, stretch…

Text: There's a knee-jerk tendency to take strangers at face value whenever they pop up in your timeline, no matter what they're saying, as long as what they're saying seems foolish; a rush counter to the traditionally theorized Gricean charity one would only summon for a friend.

Text: @MarginalScribbl I suppose the US market overall might not be fond of the flavor, but surely the niche that supports it would still make it profitable? (Disclaimer: I have no idea how the chip business works.)

FWIW, I like all the other flavors India gets too, but that one is the greatest thing.

Text: @MarginalScribbl You can get it in Indian stores here, of course, but that doesn't satisfy me. I want to get it in Safeways and A&amp;Ps and CVSes and newsstands. I want it accessible at all times, anywhere.

Text: @Styl_oh @MarginalScribbl Halidram's has some good stuff. I particularly like their line of Pesticide Biscuits. (No, no, they're good)

I guess the proper Indian soda thing you're supposed to have is Thums Up, instead of Coca-Cola. I don't care much for soda, so it's all whatever to me, but so folks say.

But I concur on upma being the greatest. (Though folks may disagree with me on always eating it with yogurt and pickle)
