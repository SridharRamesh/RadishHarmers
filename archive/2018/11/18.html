<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence Those two are examples of math interfacing with physics, which I have more muddled feelings on, than simply math and other math (although my vector/quaternion example is of course highly influenced by the way we think from happening to live in a (3, 1)-dimensional universe).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence Anyway, when I say &quot;natural order&quot;, I am being somewhat facetious, for it is very much my view, indeed oft my angry and strident view, that math is an arbitrarily traversable web and not a naturally ordered tower as the impression is often given. There is no One True Order.<br><br>BUT:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence I would think that 9 times out of 10, in alternate histories, the orderings of discovery in the examples I gave above would happen to go the other way. They were random quirks of history.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence GR -&amp;gt; RG is very plausible to me, sure. QM -&amp;gt; LA would be utterly insane. Linear algebra comes up in so many other contexts, which were already being studied in so many ways. The basic idea of solving simultaneous affine equations. Like, Cramer&#39;s rule was already given in 1750.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence Anyway, it&#39;s not even that I think there&#39;s an order-violation in the examples I gave above, as such, I shouldn&#39;t say it quite that way. Rather…</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence It&#39;s just, amusingly arbitrary in each case, that the one random particular connection became the historical first instance of discovery of the grand idea, and not any other one random particular connection. It&#39;s amusing arbitrariness to observe.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence But even you, physics fan you, must find it a bit odd vectors came from quaternions. You&#39;d think physicists would recognize 2d/3d vectors as useful concepts in their own right long before pondering 4d quantities with a noncommutative multiplication Hamilton struggled to devise.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence Well, that&#39;s the same kind of absurdity I feel in all my examples. Not all my examples should be taken as particularly &quot;abstract&quot;; vector analysis in a very &quot;concrete&quot; 3d vector sense, as now ubiquitous throughout even basic physics, arose from quaternions, which is mindboggling.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence Yes, I would too, but the fact that there was a period of controversy approaching and around the turn of the century as to whether basic physics should be phrased in terms of respectable quaternions or in terms of newfangled vectors suggests… something weird going on.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence Right. But it seems you are emphasizing abstraction to arbitrary dimension, when again still weird is that apparently even just 3d vectors and their specifics, a la Gibbs&#39; Vector Analysis (1901), were controversial as reformulations of physics competing with older quaternions.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence See https://t.co/i1f3eurTmu, where it is explicit that this conception of vectors was specifically 3d and rooted in ordinary geometry (the old &quot;A vector is a quantity with magnitude and direction&quot; chestnut is given as initial definition, and then 3-coordinate schemes introduced).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@quasicoherence Yes, it definitely does. So it&#39;s weird to me, quaternionic physics prior to Gibbs&#39; vectoral physics, but of course at the time, well, everyone had their (quirk of history) reasons to be happy doing things as they did and not immediately switching over to something else.</p></blockquote>
