Ok, yeah, that one has some cells that are legally lowercase ùêã&#39;s instead of ùêà&#39;s; it&#39;s a risk, but you still come out ahead. You in or out?</pre>

<pre>@AntiFashGordon I feel like you&#39;re imagining a checkmark to do way more than a checkmark does. Anyone who&#39;d be looking for a checkmark and notice its absence is studious enough to tell the difference between different accounts anyway. It&#39;s a silly system which marks official clout, nothing more. https://t.co/0DFvitr9XQ</pre>

<pre>@AntiFashGordon I will say, and this will come across oddly but it&#39;s true, I regret that I quote-tweeted instead of screenshotting, because it was not my intention to cause her distress, even though I did feel there was something silly in the checkmark plea worth noting for a different audience.</pre>

<pre>@AntiFashGordon I don&#39;t find her being harassed funny, and I wish it to end. It&#39;s the incongruity between the described scale of the problem (Nazis) and described scale of solution (a Twitter checkmark) which struck me as silly. But I will re-think about whether this was wrong to find silly.</pre>
