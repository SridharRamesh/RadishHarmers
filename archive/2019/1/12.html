<pre>Everyone rolls their eyes when I pick 4&#39;33&quot; as my karaoke jam, but once I start nailing it, belting out the wind stirring outside during the first movement, each of the raindrops pattering the roof during the second, and so on, they cheer in amazement. This throws me off my game.</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence @jayleophillips Huh, I thought it would just take everyone a moment&#39;s reflection, no more. But I suppose I&#39;ve only brought this on myself; this is the problem when I put too many sadposts on the same account as the jokestream. People stop recognizing which should be read as which.</pre>

<pre>No one who claims to be especially principled at argument because of their profession (lawyers, mathematicians, philosophers) actually is, in their ordinary lives. They make all the same disingenuous moves to hold all the same foolish positions as everyone else.</pre>

<pre>I first became a regular poster at the Straight Dope Message Board. Years and years active there; a reputation and fans. Now I never visit. I&#39;ve occasionally re-used math I wrote there, but mostly, what a waste of time. Here I repeat my mistakes. I could&#39;ve had a family by now.</pre>

<pre>&quot;My mother said to me, &#39;If you are a soldier, you will be a general. If you are a monk, you will be Pope&#39;. Instead, I was a painter, and became Picasso.&quot; —Picasso

That is so me. When I grow up, I don&#39;t want to be some general or pope. I burn with originality. I shall be Picasso.</pre>
