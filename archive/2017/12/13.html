<pre>It is always incredible to me how tightly balanced the two parties have calibrated their races, such close elections, when each particular demographic you can think of swings hard to one party or the other. They&#39;ve managed to carve up the demographics in such precise equilibrium.</pre>

<pre>@zedtivx This is what people say, and fair enough, but it&#39;s always incredible to me that it&#39;s possible. One might imagine it not being quite possible to pick policy positions that&#39;d carve the space of demographics up this way, and yet, incredibly, it turns out it is.</pre>

<pre>@zedtivx Besides, also, just because there are two parties doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll strike a 50-50 balance naturally. One might be much better than the other. On purely powerholding grounds, each seeks a 100-0 balance in their favor, after all; each wants every demographic, if it can have it.</pre>

<pre>In 4th grade, I went to my elementary school library to find a book on &quot;algebra&quot;, this higher math topic I&#39;d heard of but of which I had no idea what it was. The book I got ended up being about abstract algebra (?!!), but I didn&#39;t realize that distinction till years later.</pre>

<pre>It discussed the symmetric group S_4 (not by that name, though) using the example of ways of rotating (as in permuting) the four tires on a car. [This is the example I remember most vividly from it; the example I could use like dental records to confirm its identity].</pre>

<pre>It defined an &quot;algebra&quot; as something like a ring (the &quot;algebra over a field&quot; sense of the word, though I don&#39;t recall it discussing fields as such; just, an &quot;algebra&quot; being any abstract structure with two operations satisfying associativity, distributivity, etc.).</pre>

<pre>It was quite readable even to 4th grade me, and though part of that was my interest in the material, I think the greater part is testament to the book (after all, apparently somehow it was felt fit for it to end up in an elementary school library, though this still shocks me…).</pre>

<pre>Relatedly: https://t.co/jP1X2EClyY. Poor dog, sure (cf. the old Norm MacDonald joke), but Jesus Christ, does no one care about humans also anymore? (All dogs go to heaven and deserve comfortable lives, but humans have to earn it by the sweat and merit of their brow, yeah, yeah…)</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby @StacyBeckley Oh, shit, I didn&#39;t think about this connection. I don&#39;t actually think anything about the SF SPCA in particular, to be clear; I&#39;m more concerned about society in general&#39;s treatment of the homeless. The very ability for there to be such a thing as homeless people, etc.</pre>
