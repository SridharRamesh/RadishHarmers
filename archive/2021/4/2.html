<pre>April Fool&#39;s! With some playing around, you can convince yourself any such setup would be such that any two people have the same number of friends. From this, one can then reason about the eigenvalue multiplicities of the adjacency matrix, to rule out the possibility altogether.</pre>

<pre>@zona_moribunda People are often intimidated by the words &quot;eigenvalue&quot; and &quot;eigenvector&quot;. They must not be taught well, but the concept is very simple. Far too simple for there to be so much intimidation.</pre>

<pre>@zona_moribunda If an output of some function is a multiple of the corresponding input, that input is called an &quot;eigenvector&quot;, and the amount it multiplies by is called an &quot;eigenvalue&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@zona_moribunda I spoke above about the eigenvalues of a matrix. Well, when I speak like this, what I mean is to think of the matrix as representing a function: It turns input vectors into output vectors by multiplying by them. Any vector that gets sent to a multiple of itself is an eigenvector.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@zona_moribunda Here, by saying one vector is a multiple of another, I mean the situation where it&#39;s just scaled up by some factor.

So if you have some operation or matrix that sends &amp;lt;1, 8, 9&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;3, 24, 27&amp;gt;, then &amp;lt;1, 8, 9&amp;gt; is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 3. It gets scaled by a factor of 3.</pre>

<pre>@zona_moribunda Well, it&#39;s easy to see how an operation behaves on an eigenvector. It just scales up, by definition. If you can break down arbitrary inputs into sums of eigenvectors, and the operation behaves linearly with respect to these sums, then once you know the function&#39;s eigenvectors and</pre>

<pre>@zona_moribunda their eigenvalues, you understand how the function behaves in general on arbitrary inputs. (For example, you can then also easily tell what happens as you repeatedly apply the function over and over to its own outputs.)</pre>

But then, learning calculus isn&#39;t really the reason people pay such money to get the degree that lets them get jobs, and better jobs if they went to the right school, which... teaches better calculus? It&#39;s all a sham.</pre>
