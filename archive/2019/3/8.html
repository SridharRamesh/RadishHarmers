<pre>I&#39;m very prone to giving a bunch of disclaimers and CYA footnotes and so on too, but when it prevents you from just being able to say some blunt things which should be heard bluntly… At some point, mealy-mouthedness is not so much a tic as a deliberate and criticizable ideology.</pre>

<pre>@annakhachiyann @mtracey @Tankie_Viciedo I don&#39;t think he has ulterior motives, as such. I just think he might as well say &quot;Trump is bad&quot;. Whatever, just say it. When the charge is that you physically cannot say it, it really is funny to engage in such replies, turn this way and that, but never just say it. It tickles.</pre>

<pre>If you want a say in what the government decides, donate large sums of money to the party in power (or both, to hedge your bets).

If you want a say in what the government decides but don&#39;t have large sums of money free to donate, agree with someone who does.</pre>

<pre>When Disney first opened Tomorrowland, crowds could hardly contain their excitement, delivering rave reviews and smashing all prior attendance records. But by the next day, turnout began dropping, and in the years to come, the attraction came to be considered passé and obsolete.</pre>
