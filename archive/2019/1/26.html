<pre>RT @RadishHarmers: I hate online. I hate politics. I just want to do math (100% principled argument) and comedy (0% principled argument).</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence I thought of adding a disclaimer to indicate that &quot;principled&quot; for me here means something very different from &quot;formal&quot; or the rigidity people call &quot;rigorous&quot;. &quot;Principled&quot; meaning like non-disingenuous, a kind of argumentative standard that characterizes math even informally.</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence It should by now be very clear that I take a very dim view of reducing math to formal math, even in, uh, principle.

But also, my real point here is to note my very dim view of considering jokes as principled or as ideally getting at principled truths; &quot;truth in comedy&quot; blather.</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence Or maybe my point is to note how tedious social media and entertainment has become now that everyone and everything is aiming to be some stripe of punditry, or something. I&#39;m sure I had a point once.</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence What I meant by the parenthetical was only that the math standard for what counts as proof is quite principled, as opposed to political discussion (no one on here would ever admit evidence that weakens their desired result), and diametrically opposite from what makes comedy tick.</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence I don&#39;t mean that there is nothing in math other than proving things. I just mean, when it comes to the math standard for proof, the standard tends to be fairly principled; the sense in which mathematicians are unhappy taking Goldbach&#39;s Conjecture as sufficiently established.</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence All of this replying I am doing is hoisting myself with my own petard, since my original comment is somewhat of a joke, and my point was that jokes don&#39;t have to be correct in any 100% principled way. Yet here I am defending it to the death...</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence The Feynman anecdote about searching for every possible way in which one might be, for all one&#39;s hopes, wrong. That&#39;s the &quot;principled&quot; aspect of mathematical argumentative standard. Scientists can shy away, but this is very ingrained into math culture, its ideas of &quot;what counts&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence Like I said somewhere here, the parenthetical wasn&#39;t meant to describe everything that happens in math, just the nature of what is considered a mathematical argument. (And ofc there are different logical systems too, etc, but this still falls under my umbrella of &quot;principled&quot;).</pre>
