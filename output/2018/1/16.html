Text: My ears are burning. Is someone talking about me? Oh, and my gums are bleeding; I guess because I've been talking about other people. Also, my skin and hair are shedding; not sure what's going on there.

Text: In the 50s, we used to say "colored person", but now we've learnt, through the efforts of our top scientists, that "person of color" is the appropriate term.

Text: A lot of folks seem to have the position that only people who always, without fail, have made the perfect and most calculatedly rational decisions deserve attention and redress for their misfortunes. What a poverty of imagination for the kind of better society we could construct.

Text: @christapeterso For the Morning Star to be the Evening Star is a schizoid observation, and therefore, uh, manifestly false; sorry, Frege, close but you whiffed the landing.

Text: I feel so guilty all the time, and I'm not really sure why. It's not over any moral or ethical lapses; when I examine it, it's just over stuff like "I should've worked harder to make more money for my employer…" or "I should've been better at accumulating awards and prestige…".

Text: (I've tweeted this before, yes, yes. Like I said, I feel this way all the time. My hope and rock-solid expectation is that the right accomplishment will destroy the feeling forever. My hope is also that this accomplishment comes in the form of tweeting. https://t.co/1dRFL9qL9c)

Text: Mixing sincerity and gag, the thought itself and its reflexive deprecation, switching from one to the next and then back in the same thread.

A tonal mish-mash only penetrable to attempted exegesis with direct aid from the author. (And when he dies, so will this possibility.)

Text: Everyone made such a big deal about object permanence when I was a young tot, so I boned up on the concept real strenuously. From when I exit till when I re-enter a room, I assume you all stand perfectly still. Sorry about that; when you get an itch, it must be awful.
