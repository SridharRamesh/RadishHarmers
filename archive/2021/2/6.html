<pre>@da_last_boss In case this isn&#39;t clear, this is a logician&#39;s intentional parody of Objectivist logic.

<pre>Poor guy. Sorry about blowing up your spot, but I assume you&#39;re like 19. As you get older, you&#39;ll come to learn that I am the last guy to be asking for dating advice. https://t.co/3lS1s6NV8M</pre>

<pre>@fivefactormodel @PlateauUkok @AliceFromQueens If the UBI is paid on a regular enough schedule, it&#39;ll be pretty difficult for anyone to end up losing the ability to cover their primal needs. Regardless, how does one want to help such people? Fine, then do that and also give everyone a UBI.</pre>
