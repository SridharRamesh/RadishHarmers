<pre>Once, a friend of friends I&#39;d known for years, who I got the sense didn&#39;t like me very much and thus who I tried to avoid forcing my unwelcome banter on, told me just before moving away how they&#39;d long considered me an asshole for being so clearly uninterested in talking to them.</pre>

<pre>The initial pun here is due to @quasicoherence, who was unable to find a better thing to do with this, and neither am I. I now log this attempt for posterity primarily so that some day I see it again and have the punch-up breakthrough I was unable to accomplish today.</pre>

(BTW, I deleted my post this was in reply to for stupid inscrutable reasons; don&#39;t read anything into it.)</pre>
