<pre>I think maybe I&#39;d be less fixated on this thing if it hadn&#39;t happened 5 seconds from the front door of the apartment I&#39;ve lived in for 11 years and always considered a &quot;safe area&quot;.

(Or, I dunno, it&#39;s been less than 48 hours, so maybe I hardly need apologize for being &quot;fixated&quot;.)</pre>

And I don&#39;t mind joking about it or whatever. It&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing too, though moreso IRL than on here, for whatever reason.</pre>

Up through recently, if you said &quot;Nothing, with increasing worry...&quot;, you&#39;d be correct. But in a week I start an exciting gig, a job that&#39;s a far better match for my skills and interests than I thought likely to come my way anytime soon!</pre>

But it&#39;s true I did used to do a fairly privileged &quot;something&quot; before I did nothing, though that &quot;something&quot; (which I hated) was very much not into dressing up; that would&#39;ve stuck out like a sore thumb.</pre>
