Text: Everything feels disgusting when I'm sick. Food, weather; even abstract concepts turn my stomach when sick. Parsimony? No thank you. Grimm's Law? Nauseating. A rectangle twice as wide as it is tall? UGH, could the world NOT, I'm trying to get BETTER over here.

Text: I have six racist bones in my body, but they're those tiny ones in the ear. The smallest ones. I'm basically non-racist. The rest of you guys, though, wow, the filth I hear coming out of your mouths.

Text: Unpopular opinion: popular edition.

I don't like watching any movie or TV show about high school, because I was popular. My kind does not get a fair shake in Hollywood. Writers' rooms forever villainize us for our crimes of being charismatic and friendly.

Text: @pixelatedboat Huh. When I try to sign up for Instagram, it tells me my email address is already in use, but when I try to recover my password, it tells me it has no record of my account. Bizarre and frustrating. Anyway, from my prison cell, I wish you a happy birthday!
