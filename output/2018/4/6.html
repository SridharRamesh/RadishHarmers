Text: @reezels It is amazing to have this much correspondence between strangers readily available and archived. I just wish Twitter didn't make it a crapshoot which partial subset of the full list it will decide to show you when looking at who Liked any particular popular tweet.

Text: Hm, only watched parts so far, but given where I'm up to, it seems to have completely elided mention of Garry Shandling's picket line crossing incident. The doc mentions how Mitzi Shore didn't used to give him spots, and then she did, but not the pretty big event in the middle.
