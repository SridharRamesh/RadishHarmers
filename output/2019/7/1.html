Text: @BUSSCRO @WhiteSoxSlater Decided to look it up, and people can check my numbers on this:

Germany had 2 million combat deaths in WWI, comprising over 3% of its population. 3% of the U.S. population would be 9 million people. The American combat deaths from Iraq + Afghanistan are under 10,000.

Text: @BUSSCRO @WhiteSoxSlater Furthermore, the Iraqi deaths are under half a million, and the Afghan deaths are in the hundreds of thousands.

Text: As far as I'm concerned, ALL seasons of greater-than-baseline temperature reckoned between the appropriate such solstice and equinox for one's given hemisphere are "hot girl summer". Pardon me: hot WOMAN summer.

Text: @htpyFiber @johncarlosbaez Yes. Consider the partial sum of the harmonic series up through 1/n. Let k = floor(log_2(n)). Note that only one of the terms in our partial sum has a denominator divisible by 2^k; specifically, the term 1/2^k itself.

Text: @htpyFiber @johncarlosbaez All the other terms can be given a common denominator in which the power of 2 in the prime factorization is less than k. A fraction with this denominator cannot match an integer minus 1/2^k, and thus the overall partial sum cannot be an integer. QED.

Text: I have only two interests, and neither of them has any realistic chance of ever going anywhere, leading to anything, amounting to anything. Still, I have to do something with my time. I'm going to be alive and often conscious regardless.

Text: Eskimo is a vicious slur for the indigenous peoples of the Arctic region (dispersed throughout North America, Greenland, and Siberia). The preferred term is coolie.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law Perhaps not as improbable or full-on slur-ish, but it's always fun to recall the chain of words across various languages resulting in Folangji in China, Faranj in Ethiopian, and of course major hits in Persian, Hindi, Tamil, Thai, etc, all going back to Franks in ancient Europe.

Text: My former Bay Area sketch group @naptimecomedy, who are dead to me, made this new sketch, which is dead to me. But as I haven't yet made anything of my own in New York, feel free to watch and enjoy this in the meanwhile. https://t.co/0fRYiYjh8y

Text: Rather, feel COMPELLED to watch and enjoy this. You'll happily waste time reading a thousand other tossed off 280 character nothings scrolling by before and after. Treat yourself to a break where you get to watch an actual video made with actual production quality and effort.
