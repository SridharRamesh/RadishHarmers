Text: It's not that I want more followers out of a vacuous urge to see the Followers number go up, a perversely cultivated drive for validation via some website's meaningless contrived metric. I'm not stupid. I want more followers to get me more Likes.

Text: Actually, Space Force is a misnomer (some would say a "fictitious force"). It's just the same old Air Force, reconstrued from a particular accelerating frame of reference.

Text: Spotting a poorly designed lottery with million bucks payout but 0.0005% odds at $2 entry, the mathematician in me springs to action. I liquidate assets to buy myriad upon myriad tickets. Not even gambling; statistics! Still, for extra confidence, I buy each with my lucky number.

Text: When I first posted this (back in the 140 era), I was too scared to reveal who I was subtweeting. But today, I can confirm what some of you have already guessed: 007 is my codename for Bond. (Something Bond. I won't give it away entirely yet, for plausible deniability.)
