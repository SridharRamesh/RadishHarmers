<pre>@sunjuchethot Like near everyone, I didn&#39;t watch Tuca &amp;amp; Bertie, but I agree with those who say it would&#39;ve been nice if they kept making it. Some people liked watching it, others liked making it, so, a successful match. I support all such. But how ridiculous to give it such grand significance.</pre>

&quot;Nooo, don&#39;t kill yourself, ur so sexy!!&quot;

I know, a bit dark, to take it all the way there. But good comedy often has a bit of an edge to it!</pre>

<pre>It&#39;s just too bad copaganda ends up affecting people&#39;s real-life attitudes also. Not sure what to do about that. Genuinely, I&#39;m not sure. It&#39;s frustrating for everyone to defer to authority so readily in real life, but it&#39;s entirely natural to have such storytelling archetypes.</pre>

<pre>Accurate reflection of real life isn&#39;t the only rubric for evaluating how interesting stories are. Fiction can be made just to entertain. Dudley Do-Right or Monk or the like wouldn&#39;t necessarily be improved by making them corrupted agents of an irredeemable institution.</pre>

<pre>It&#39;s frustrating if meant as an accurate reflection of real life, but as a storytelling framework, it&#39;s sometimes very naturally convenient to have a setup with default &quot;good guy&quot; and &quot;bad guy&quot; roles, muddied a bit but not entirely. https://t.co/55cUiMjf1Y</pre>

<pre>@zlingman I&#39;ve had the same thought so many times. I think, though (and what do I know?), the real skill that must be built, sans which nothing can happen, is to learn to do the things that require followthrough WITHOUT having to prepare the ground perfectly through abstinence of all else.</pre>

<pre>@zlingman Yup, I don&#39;t have the answers. I just know that my attempts to quit Twitter 100% have not resulted in success and productivity either, so this is my current mindset. But what finally works will surely be different for different people. So, I&#39;ll just say, I wish you best of luck!</pre>

<pre>I&#39;ve fucked my neck up pretty badly, somehow; pulling pain with every little movement this way or that. I&#39;m at the age where doctors never fix anything, indeed never even diagnose anything, but it&#39;d be cool if I could sweet-talk them into making one last exception.</pre>
