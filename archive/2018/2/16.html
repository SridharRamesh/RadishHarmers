<pre>It&#39;s fine by me that people post tritely about the horror of gun violence. It&#39;s not possible to have an original thought on the matter, but it doesn&#39;t bother me for people to keep repeating the old correct ones, as the repetitive situation keeps warranting.</pre>

<pre>I had no idea Marx had written on the subject! In reading his calculus papers, it&#39;s not immediately obvious to me what the intended contributions were or the background context of the era, and thus they&#39;re neither obviously good nor bad. Will keep reading. https://t.co/wsOMPOPXm0</pre>

<pre>I suppose this is a couple decades after, but still roughly contemporaneous with, the work of Bolzano, Cauchy, Weierstrass…, and thus things like &quot;How to make conceptual sense of dy/dx, this 0/0 ratio, this Berkeleyan paradox?&quot; were in the air as not entirely settled matters.</pre>

<pre>(Not that one has to follow Cauchy-Weierstrass formalism even now, but this is my attempt to understand the context in which Marx was writing things which might seem, to a modern mathematician now thoroughly soaked in this tradition, to be the ramblings of a &quot;befuddled beginner&quot;)</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence In terms of contributions to modern math, certainly there will be nothing, but in terms of seeing the history of understanding and interpretations of calculus, this random data point is an interesting curiosity.</pre>
