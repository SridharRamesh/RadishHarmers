<pre>@quasicoherence @sigfpe Right, but the probabilistic laws of QM are actually phrased probabilistically: there is probability X of such and such. The 2nd Law is phrased as a claim with certainty: entropy always rises. The more accurate(?) probabilistic claim is obscured; I&#39;m not even sure what it is.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe @quasicoherence Well, QM isn&#39;t just complex probability (and Born&#39;s rule), abstractly. That&#39;s part of it, but as physical law, it&#39;s also some claims about how this relates to specific behaviors of specific physical particles.</pre>

<pre>@FlatteringRam You could definitely learn C++ if you wanted to. But also, be aware, C++ is itself an obtusely designed language. It wasn&#39;t handed down by the gods or anything. It&#39;s natural to find it confusing; it has plenty of unnecessary confusion designed into it.</pre>
