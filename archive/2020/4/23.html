<pre>It&#39;s like they say. &quot;Women cut off their left hand to get railed by Ryan from the OC, men cut off their right hand to get railed by Ryan from the OC&quot;. (I don&#39;t know how the convention became established, but the right hand is the gay one.) https://t.co/HvG5HNeWjl</pre>

<pre>Sure, sure, shit on people fleeing high NYC rent, forced by circumstance to try anew to eke out a living in middle America, overwhelmed, resource-starved. Direct your anger at them for abdicated personal responsibility and not the landlord system itself. Very &quot;leftist&quot; of you.</pre>

<pre>@whitebabyhands I know you love living in New York, where you live, but it&#39;s hardly a &quot;plague&quot; or &quot;pandemic&quot; to not be able to go to CBGB every night or whatever you&#39;re on about. Many as they age come to find themselves with other priorities, which take precedence over the drawbacks of NYC rent.</pre>
