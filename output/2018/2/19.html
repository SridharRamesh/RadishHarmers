Text: If you have to get hit by a car, make it an ambulance. But if you have to get hit by two cars, either traveling oppositely or in succession, make one a subcompact, such as the 2017 Smart Fortwo with electric drive, while keeping the other an ambulance. Good luck and God bless.

Text: I'm an equal opportunity offender. I'll mock anyone and everyone, whether they're a black gay Muslim, or a white gay Republican, or an Asian gay quadriplegic. No one's safe from my scathing wit.
