Text: @JimfromBC It's all good. I genuinely rarely mind replies; if they're enjoyable, great, and if not, no skin off my nose.

Text: @oodduuss Only when I'm able to reuse joke ideas in some form or another off this site. But I appreciate your blinkered, foolish perspective.

Text: @jcreed This way of thinking already in itself isn't limited to A_n, mind you. The order of the product of adjacent generators isn't necessarily 3.

Text: @jcreed Yeah, all quotients of what A_n would be if the order 3 conditions were dropped; i.e., if unlabelled lines in a Coxeter diagram had label ∞ rather than 3 by fiat, i.e. meant only "Needn't commute" and nothing more. Presumably you mean the same thing when discussing D_n, then.

Text: @jcreed It's a nice perspective, though, for non-regular polytopes, is it that useful to focus on flags rather than cells? It's equivalent to the concept at https://t.co/KX9MqcRlIw, but there spelt out via incidence relations on cells, which seems more direct than thinking of flags.

Text: @jcreed The key thing is just "Given cell A incident to cell B of dimension higher, incident to cell C of dimension one higher, there is precisely one other cell B' of same dimension as B, also incident to A and C".

Text: Folks will say stuff like "I'm 1/3 white", and then other folks will be like "Duuh, how'd you do that? You can't get a fraction like that…". It's not hard, dummy. At the time of their birth, they had one white grandparent, out of three living grandparents. Just think for a sec.

Text: Batman was originally called "the Bat-Man", which stood for "the Battery-Manslaughterer". He is willing to harm, and even to kill, but NOT with malice aforethought.

Text: @ZachWeiner Finite automata in themselves are algorithms with finite memory capacity. General algorithms can do things that finite automata can't (like counting arbitrarily high as part of their calculations, say).

Text: @ZachWeiner That having been said, a Turing machine (thus, general computation) is just a finite automaton hooked up to some kind of potentially infinite memory device (a one-dimensional read/write tape, as Turing would have it, but the exact details don't matter).

Text: @ZachWeiner Or why not "finite memory programs?". Because history is weird. All the names were picked long ago, before we lived in the computer era, and before currently standard terminology for lots of other computery things was so standard.
