Text: Oh, you're just the kind of cool spontaneous free spirit who would and has traveled to a foreign country on three hours notice? I don't care. Not my type. I wouldn't even go to the U.S. on 3 hours notice. It takes me 4 hours notice just to wake up in my apartment in the morning.

Text: @rahuldphys @AEukaryote @bridgietherease This feels to me like you're muddying my purely beautiful math with some filthy empirical applications in mind (exponential growth isn't rare in math), but I'm not terribly opinionated about a ratio vs. its reciprocal.

Text: @rahuldphys @AEukaryote @bridgietherease Oh, I'm all for you thinking of e^{-1} as its own constant with its own name (ə, say) in the context of frequently reasoning about exponential decay. I do this too, anyway. I just think e is also worthy of some note, and in some sense more often of note at that.

Text: @rahuldphys @AEukaryote @bridgietherease What I endorse is this: In all contexts, grant yourself the defns. that will make your life easiest to have at ready hand, thinking directly in terms of the concepts it would be best to think in terms of (carving your concerns at the joints), and not some other roundabout thing.

Text: Not a lot of white people know this, but the last names "Singh" or "Kaur" are not just generic Indian names. They specifically indicate that the person is Indo-Canadian.
