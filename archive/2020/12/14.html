<pre>You can build this number …1787109376 up like so: The fifth power of 6 ends in 76, the fifth power of 76 ends in 376, the fifth power of 376 ends in 9376, and so on, ad infinitum. The fifth power of its last N digits always ends in its last N + 1 many digits.</pre>

Consider the number …1787109376. When you square it, cube it, or any such thing, it gives you back the same number. If you subtract one from it, you get …1787109375. This is its own third power. Multiply those two together and you get …0000000. https://t.co/AQ85qvbee0</pre>

<pre>@tristanybother It depends on what you mean by &quot;this&quot;. Taking repeated powers doesn&#39;t usually keep ending in the digits you started with, but you happen to have picked one of the other cases where it does. The sixth power of 5 ends in 25, the sixth power of 25 ends in 625, and so on forever.</pre>

<pre>@tristanybother …1787109376 is built up in such a way that will always be 1 mod 2^N, and 0 mod 5^N. Those properties only depend on its last N digits, and will clearly ensure that its square, cube, etc, all match itself. But why does the fifth power trick work to build it up?</pre>

<p>
<pre>@tristanybother One can quickly convince oneself from there it keeps producing the unique N digits which are 0 mod 2^N and 1 mod 5^N.

Similar reasoning shows that if you keep taking sixth powers starting with 5, you get the unique N digits which are 1 mod 2^N and 0 mod 5^N.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@tristanybother Here, let me take stab #2 at giving the explanation pithily: Suppose X is even. Then clearly X^5 will contain at least one more power of 2. So every time you take fifth powers, X becomes zero mod a higher power of 2.</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>@tristanybother Similarly, suppose X - 1 is divisible by 5. Then X^5 - 1 = (X - 1) * (1 + X + X^2 + X^3 + X^4).

Since X = 1 mod 5, the 1 + X + X^2 + X^3 + X^4 factor comes out to a multiple of 5. So X^5 - 1 contains one more power of 5 than X - 1 does.</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>@tristanybother So every time you take fifth powers, X becomes 1 mod a higher power of 5.

So, starting with 6 (which is both even and 1 mod 5) and taking successive fifth powers, we get values which are zero mod each successive power of 2, and which are 1 mod each successive power of 5.</pre>

<pre>@asmeurer I didn&#39;t mean to imply &quot;everything you think you know is wrong&quot;, which I agree is weird mysticism. Let&#39;s put it this way. There&#39;s not a lot of insight into anything interesting about π to be gained by knowing whether its hundredth digit is even or odd.</pre>

<pre>@asmeurer Just as there&#39;s not a lot of insight into anything interesting about sqrt(2) to be gained by knowing whether its hundredth digit is even or odd. The interesting facts about sqrt(2) have to do with the fact that it squares to two.</pre>

<pre>@asmeurer It&#39;s good for comparing two values to see which is larger, that sort of thing. That&#39;s of course important. All that is fine. My purpose wasn&#39;t to say decimal notation is bad, of course it has its value.</pre>

<pre>@asmeurer The most direct notation is to write *************. The most direct way to denote the magnitude of sqrt(2) or π is to draw two lines, one of which is precisely sqrt(2) or π as long as the other. But that&#39;s of course rather hard to reason with, in its infinite precision.</pre>

<pre>@Jewbacchus @tristanybother You can think of these infinite strings of digits as numbers in themselves (&quot;10-adic numbers&quot;, as I said), they follow lots of the same rules as ordinary numbers but also have some special unusual ones (like, for example, the ability to multiply two nonzero things and get zero).</pre>

<pre>@Jewbacchus @tristanybother Or you can think of what I just said as nothing more than a fancy way of saying these simple things I said at the start, because that&#39;s all it amounts to in the end. https://t.co/1ZB0jjM5bT</pre>

<pre>@Jewbacchus @tristanybother When we use these leftwards infinite digit strings, the properties of the number system we get in the end actually depend a lot on what base we&#39;re using. If you use a prime (or prime power) base, you get more of the familiar rules, like that nonzero values can&#39;t multiply to zero.</pre>

<pre>@Jewbacchus @tristanybother This is unlike ordinarily. Ordinarily, our rightwards infinite digit strings end up can be seen as describing the same number system in the end, regardless of what base we&#39;re using. But with the leftwards infinite systems, that all changes.</pre>

<pre>@Jewbacchus @tristanybother Anyway, I&#39;ll leave it at that for now, but if you want to read up more, look into &quot;p-adic numbers&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@Jewbacchus @tristanybother Hm, not particularly that I can think of. Remember, you can multiply ANY number that ends in 76 by ANY number that ends in 75 to get something that ends in 00, and so on, so you can get all kinds of leading digits in that way.</pre>

<pre>@tristanybother I&#39;ve deleted my lesser explanation to try to make Twitter show the better one now instead. The threading on this site is weird.</pre>

<pre>@SeanMcCarthyCom In fairness, self-proclaimed leftists/Marxists/etc can fall into such traps too, hung up on the term &quot;worker&quot; and thus fetishizing life as needing to be work rather than leisure, in worker vs. shirker mindset, a la Soviet charges of &quot;social parasitism&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@HapmpL @SeanMcCarthyCom I gave a historical example already. The Soviet Union considered itself Marxist, yet went so far as to criminalize being insufficiently worker bee; e.g., Joseph Brodsky being sentenced to hard labor on the charge of being an odd job poet rather than a socially productive worker.</pre>
