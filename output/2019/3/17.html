Text: Everything I do, my day-in, day-out labor, I do it not to put food on the table. The human body can go weeks between eating. No, I do it to keep my phone charged.

Text: When I'm one of five distinct fake me's, that's the real me. My stock of different personas for different audiences and contexts, my box of trademark staples; I reject any obligation to have something yet further on top of that.

Text: @papa_rosh But also, I'm wary of an Oranjello/Lemonjello situation here, just less racist. I never believe any of these stories. I don't believe anyone knew anyone in high school with a name.

Text: Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes, well I almost fell for my Lola
Lolololo Lola Lolololo Lola
Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo. Lo. Lo. Lo. Lo. La.
Light of my life, fire of my loins
My sin, my soul
The tip of the tongue taking a trip of 28 steps

Text: @haircut_hippie @neoliberal_dad We must not conflate the serenade author with the serenade protagonist. When David Bowie had sex with 14-year-old Lori, it was not meant as an endorsement; he was deliberately portraying himself as a statutory rapist who would next hand her off to be kidnapped by Jimmy Page.

Text: So far as ways to be torn go, my favorite is between difficult decisions, such as whether or not to watch the latest ambitious yet flawed film by a talented but problematic creator, that sort of thing, while among my biggest peeves remains limb from limb.

Text: @rahuldphys In fairness, the referenced memorization here is but a single bit, and I sympathize with being completely unable to do it. "Type I/II error" is awful terminology people should just replace with "false positive/negative".
