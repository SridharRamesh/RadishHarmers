Text: @NE0GRIT Much like these actors, this post has never gone away. It was made in August 2020 as well, but deleted. See https://t.co/3vdIftb6Jv.

Text: @staxringold @GarbageApe Even that was not the first instance. See https://t.co/oZCtI2Gvii for an instance from a month earlier. Alas, that instance was deleted, though the replies to it remain accessible.

Text: @shitshowdotinfo An underknown B-level gem: Travelers on Netflix. It doesn't aspire to more than it is (and a lot of the acting apart from Eric McCormack himself is frankly mediocre). And yet, it is very enjoyable for what it is. One of the only things on Netflix enjoyable all the way to the end.

Text: @shitshowdotinfo The more prestige Netflix show touching on some similar genre in a very different way is Dark. That will seem tremendous for two seasons. Watch the first two seasons right up until but excluding the very last moment of season 2. Pretend the show ends there, do not go any further.

Text: @shitshowdotinfo Ignore the very last thing that happens in the last episode of season two. There's a climactic dramatic moment, and then it's followed by a game-changer to set up season three. Take the dramatic moment as the finale, and ignore the game-changer. You'll understand when you see it.

Text: @shitshowdotinfo Hm, there's a certain theme emerging in this list accidentally. Well, so it goes. The best out of all of these is Future Man.

Text: @soft_btw I have not seen this happen. Purely out of curiosity, so I could laugh at the complete lunatic and not in order to patch up any long-running difficulties, could you point me to these instructions?

Text: I made a joke about corona in real life earlier, on February 8, en route to New Hampshire, but its details are lost to posterity. I believe its premise was "Wouldn't it be outlandish if so-and-so [too ill to accompany us on the trip] had, or we got, or we spread coronavirus?".
