<pre>@FakeSusieQ I suspect either the person who stocked it was misled by the polysemy of &quot;algebra&quot;, or it was some New Math experiment that sat there for decades. Not quite Dummit and Foote, e.g. nothing about homomorphisms as I recall, just these rudiments, but god I wish I knew what it was.</pre>

<pre>@noahdmancino I had to look it up (I presume this is the exact same as Go), but yes. A few times. My nerd friends are obsessed with it, but I&#39;ve never gotten so into it, perhaps because I only ever find myself playing with nerd friends who are ten times more experienced with and better at it.</pre>
