Text: My date with God was disappointing. I swiped right excitedly on the bearded hunk, but he looked nothing like his pictures in person. More of just an abstract shimmering light. "Oh yeah, that's an old picture", he sheepishly explained.

Text: The solution to Wittgenstein's/Kripkenstein's "problem of following a rule", Goodman's "new riddle of induction", Quine's "gavagai" paradox, etc, is to simply disambiguate the canonical extension between plus/quus, green/grue, etc, by training a neural net using gradient descent.

Text: The Lindsay Ellis kerfuffle is bullshit of course. But the rule to follow is to just accept a certain percent of the population is insane, the world has always been this way, and thus ignore it. When you're self-employed, "cancellation" has no power over you unless you give in.
