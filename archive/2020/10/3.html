<pre>Milk handily turns undeniably foul long before becoming unhealthy to drink. Other foods lack such well-designed early warning systems. Some take advantage of this. They eat cheese and the like; they do not stop. They are mocking God&#39;s design. They are spitting in God&#39;s face.</pre>

<pre>I will never eat a fruit without washing it first, the ritual firmly ingrained in earliest childhood. Not even an orange. Not even a banana. Hand me an unwashed fruit to eat and I&#39;ll slap that shit to the ground like it&#39;s arsenic. If you hand me washed arsenic, that&#39;d be alright.</pre>
