<pre>The dynamics of online are wild as compared to the world decades ago. A naked attractive woman isn&#39;t attention-grabbing enough, we&#39;re chockablock with that, so now one must use social justice slogans to get attention for one&#39;s thirst traps while claiming to be doing the reverse.</pre>

<pre>Why do we report grades on a hundred point scale? 97 points out of hundred? Why out of a hundred? How arbitrary. How confusing. Could just as well have been out of twenty or out of six or whatever. Much clearer to grade on a zero to one scale (0.97, or 97%).</pre>

Sometimes people make a joke even if their bio isn&#39;t a joke. Some bios joke yet posts are sincere. It&#39;s not a one guard only lies, another guard…, world.</pre>
