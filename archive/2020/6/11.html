<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Recall that previously, we spaced latitudes apart from each other so that the vertical distance scale at each point matched the horizontal distance scale; vertical distances and horizontal distances got stretched by the same factor as we moved away from the Equator.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can now go ahead and build the accurate-area map entirely from the above description, same as how you could build the Mercator map from the description I gave before. But what I really want to share is another way to think about this same accurate-area map construction:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The distance scaling on the map near any point now depends on direction. This makes angles get all distorted, but the horizontal stretching and vertical squashing cancelling each other out means that areas are now accurately represented.</p></blockquote>

So one side effect will be that we can easily measure the area of the entire globe.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My claim is that making our map in this way, keeping each latitude at precisely the same height above the ground as it started at, will turn out to be the magic spacing, where vertical squash and horizontal stretch are exact opposites, keeping area the same as it started.</p></blockquote>
