Text: @christapeterso @beingandslime There are 5 classes of note. Consider: I, me, my, mine, myself. He, him, his, his, himself.

It's easy to imagine the last one is simply determined by the third, or by the second, but it is not, because it is sometimes the third and sometimes the second.

Text: Used to be if a tweet caught the corner of your eye just as you scrolled a tad or refreshed the TL, you could at least Ctrl+F some relevant words and find it again (on desktop). This no longer works, with whatever they've changed to their implementation of infinite scrolling.

Text: As the Buddha advised, I must train myself to not crave the numbers I so crave. I must train myself to post only for love of the game. —Wait, what the hell? Love of… posting? Jesus Christ. Horrible advice. Buddha, if I ever meet you on the road, watch your back, buddy.

Text: There's going to be two hits. First, 1992's "Little Miss Can't Be Wrong", breakout hit from debut album "Pocket Full of Kryptonite". Then, 1993's sophomore sensation "Two Princes", charting even higher, causing your jaw to hit the floor.

Text: Fierce debate between "intactivists" and their opponents at the Council of Jerusalem today, in the fiftieth year of our Lord. Heated arguments, even nasty tempers at times, but ultimately, resolution. Thank God that's finally settled now.

Text: @MattWatchGundam This is ambiguous, that's all. It's just ambiguous notation; it has nothing to do with math, really, just notation, language, conventions, etc. Not that any mathematician ever normally writes division this way anyway.

See https://t.co/KpDVBXLSjE.

Text: @MattWatchGundam In the specifics, you could interpret this to mean "Multiply 2 by (2 + 2), then divide 8 by that result". This of course comes out to 1.

Or you could interpret this to mean "Divide 8 by 2, then multiply that result by (2 + 2)". This of course comes out to 16.

Text: @MattWatchGundam Which one was meant? Who knows? Not every sentence is unambiguous. This is true in ordinary natural language and it's true here too. Communicating math is not something different from ordinary language. Sometimes people write ambiguous things and must clarify what they mean.

Text: @delmoi @pjmdolI This is mentioned in the above screenshot, yes. I mean, the problem is ultimately that it's ambiguous, that's all. Mathematicians don't actually talk like this, so there's no real convention for how to interpret this. (All only notation, of course. Un-ideal notation, at that.)

I yearn to feel the warmth and security of community, accepted as I am, yet only express my fears indirectly as wit.
