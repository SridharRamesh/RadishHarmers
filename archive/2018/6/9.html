<pre>@Styl_oh The superstition I&#39;ve grown convinced of, contra my earliest tweeting behavior, is that tweets must end with a period, or other punctuation mark as appropriate, to do well. No cutting characters in this way is permitted. If it&#39;s 281 with the period, better re-word something else.</pre>

<pre>Diaspora desis are oft so fucking corny because they keep pretending to be something they&#39;re not. But perhaps among the reasons why they pretend to be something they&#39;re not is because there&#39;s some default sense that diaspora is a lesser identity than &quot;authentic&quot; native desi-hood.</pre>

<pre>Diaspora desi isn&#39;t a lesser identity than subcontinental desi. It&#39;s just a different identity. It&#39;s fine. Not everything the former does differently from the latter is a mark against the former.</pre>

<pre>Everyone hates everyone who thinks they&#39;re funny or entertaining (and understandably so; what narcissism!), but also, hey, entertainers have to come from somewhere, so as far as I&#39;m concerned, take a stab at it if you like; it&#39;s fine by me. https://t.co/47HEpp8Hax</pre>

<pre>No, don&#39;t do it! Take heart: see how upset folks would be if you died (if you&#39;ve become well-accomplished)? Your life is far from meaningless and without impact (presuming you are successful and acclaimed).</pre>
