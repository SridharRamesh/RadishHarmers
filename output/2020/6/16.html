Text: @johncarlosbaez @sarah_zrf The Cantor set isn't so closely related to the triadic rationals (finite base-3 expansions; initial algebra of X + X + X with identification of "adjacent" top and bottom points) but rather to the infinite base-3 expansions.

Text: @johncarlosbaez @sarah_zrf These infinite expansions correspond to terminal coalgebras rather than initial algebras.

Text: @johncarlosbaez @sarah_zrf Specifically, we get [0, 1] as the terminal coalgebra of X + X + X with identification of "adjacent" top and bottom points, and within this sits the terminal coalgebra of X + 0 + X, with no special identifications. This terminal coalgebra of X + 0 + X is the Cantor set.

Text: @johncarlosbaez @sarah_zrf When I write "X + 0 + X" with no special identifications, I mean one copy of X sitting entirely strictly below a second copy of X.

Text: @johncarlosbaez @sarah_zrf Put another way, this is the "glued together" sum of one copy of X, whose top is glued to the bottom of the initial object 0, whose top is glued to the bottom of another copy of X, where the initial object 0 in this category has precisely two points, a distinct top and bottom.
