Text: Yeah sex is great but have you ever tried double sex? No, not that. No, it's not that either (although I can see why you'd think so). It's another thing.

Text: @sponson I'm very familiar with the historical Bell Telephone Company, and, for that matter, with Bell Labs (where both my parents worked and whose headquarters I grew up next to). I'm just not familiar with all the motives behind large corporations' financial allotment choices.

Text: @sponson Yes, AT&amp;T owned Bell Labs (not anymore, but did at the time). I never meant otherwise; I meant "invest" just in the generic sense of allotting money towards something, not in some specific sense of purchasing shares in a business entity one doesn't fully own, or whatever.
