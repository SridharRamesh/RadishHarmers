Text: Everyone understands exponential functions fine. When leaders and laypeople make bad decisions about the crisis, it's not because you could fool them with some 800 year old trick bet about grains of rice on a chessboard. That's not the locus of disagreement.

Text: @chick_in_kiev Are you asking because of this joke in particular, or you're just asking in general? 

Apart from dealing with my very worried parents who call me every day begging, pleading, crying for me to leave NYC and quarantine in NJ, I'm ok.
