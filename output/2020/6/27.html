Text: @so_so_germane This is actually interesting, for people interested in this sort of thing.

12345679 * 9 = 12345679 * 10 - 12345679 = 123456790 - 12345679 = 111111111.

And from this, it follows that 12345679 * (9 * 2) = 222222222, 12345679 * (9 * 3) = 333333333, etc.

Text: @so_so_germane I presume it's straightforward why the first part works as it does, but in case it needs more clarification, multiplying by 9 is the same as multiplying by ten and then subtracting the original number off.

Text: @so_so_germane So to multiply by 9, shift all your digits one spot to the left, and then subtract off the original digits. What you're left with are the differences between consecutive digits.

With 12345679, basically all the differences are 1, so we basically get a bunch of 1s.

Except…

Text: @so_so_germane You might wonder why we used 12345679, which goes directly from 7 to 9 at the end of 12345679. Why was that the number that made things work, instead of 123456789?

Text: @so_so_germane This is because digits keep going past the decimal point. If we calculated 123456789.000… * 9, then we'd get 111111111[-9].000…, where we have a negative digit of [-9] right before the decimal point. This amounts to the same thing as 1111111101, but it's not what we want.

Text: @so_so_germane But by using 12345679.000… = 12345678.999…, we can make up for this. All these digit differences in 12345678.999… are 1, until we're fully past the decimal point, and from then on the differences are 0.

Text: @so_so_germane I presume you're asking about getting my birthday to appear in 12345679 times some multiple of 9. And remember, 12345679 times some multiple of 9 amounts to the corresponding multiple of 111111111. So the question is, what kind of numbers can be multiples of 111111111?

Text: @so_so_germane One answer is this: Given any whole number, if it has more than nine digits total, break it into two numbers: the last nine digits, and whatever comes before those. Add those two together. Keep going in this way until you have something with nine digits or less.

Text: @so_so_germane This works because 1000000000 is just one above 999999999. Our chop and add process never changes our remainder with respect to dividing by 999999999 (which is itself a multiple of 111111111).

Text: @so_so_germane Then, once we have nine digits or less, we know that the only multiples of 111111111 are where all nine digits are the same.

Ok, that was a long explanation of some theory (and Twitter isn't good for long explanations, I know). Armed with this theory, let's put it to use.

Text: @so_so_germane And if you do the division, you will find that this is indeed a multiple of 111111111. Specifically, 993778014006221985 = 111111111 * 8944002135.

Or, expressing this in the form you may prefer to see, this equals 12345679 * 9 * 8944002135.

Ta-da!

Text: @so_so_germane You want all those 8s?

Ok. We can't hit 045888888 on the nose, but following the same idea as I did for my birthday, we subtract all of these nine digits from 9 and stick that in the front as the next segment of nine digits: 954111111045888888.

Or, if you prefer, 954111111045888888 = 12345679 * 9 * 8587000008 = 12345679 * 77283000072.

But we can keep going, we can use as many digits as we want. The whole thing has infinitely many digits, just like π or e or the square root of two.

All the digits you already knew were correct will still be there, and the next digit will be correct as well. You can keep going in this way infinitely.

Text: There's a beautiful explanation to this, but it doesn't fit on Twitter. Ask me later in some other medium. If you know mathematician jargon, the key is that the 10-adics decompose as the product of the 2-adics and 5-adics, and …87109376 is 0 in the 2-adics but 1 in the 5-adics.

We also have that …87109376 times (itself minus one) ends in zeroes, but that's slightly different than squaring it.

You almost certainly can't get birthday exactly, but you can get an eighteen digit string that starts with birthday and has extra digits afterwards.

Take X to be (digits of birthday followed by digits of 999999999 - birthday) / 111111111.

Now, if you take 1011564 and multiply by 9 and then multiply again by 12345679, you'll get 112395999887604, which starts with 112395 as desired.

Text: As always, the experience of beginning to discuss math on Twitter only reminds me it is structurally ill-suited for such discussion. I just wanted to make fun of the "I can't believe A times B equals C" genre of ultrapopular tweets, but couldn't resist hinting at some real math.

Text: Multiplications with a two digit product and a 7 at the end of a factor are a finite resource and must be preciously rationed. Megaviral posts have used up 14% (3 out of 21) of possibilities in the the last couple months alone. Once we hit 7 used, God have mercy on our souls.

Text: @beghira To get the last digit of a number in base b, you look at its remainder when you divide by b. To get its last two digits, you look at its remainder when you divide by b^2. To get its last N digits, you look at its remainder when you divide by b^N.

Text: @beghira If all of these remainders for every power of b are zero, then the number does indeed act like all of its digits in base b are zero. If you're divisible by ten, and by a hundred, and a thousand, and so on, you look like your units, hundreds, thousands, etc, digits are all zero.

Text: @beghira With finite ordinary numbers, none of this is any bother to anyone, the only way to be divisible by every huge power of b is to straight up be zero.

Text: @beghira But if we start looking at infinite digit-strings, we can make a nonzero infinite digit-string in one base which is divisible by every power of another base, so long as the first base is a multiple of the second base

Text: @beghira (The reason to have the first base be a multiple of the second base is so that it's easy to tell in the first base what remainders are when dividing by the second base).
