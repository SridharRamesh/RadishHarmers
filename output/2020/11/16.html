Text: @Seamus_Malek While there is a lower class, I am in it, while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free. That said, I would enjoy a strawberry-banana milkshake.

Text: @haikugoat Yes, I am just noting that my scorched Earth bitterness extends to bitterness at all levels of everything. Math culture has some rot even higher up. Few things are ever taught or thought as well as they should be, even among experts. Lots of mindless ritual repetition even there.

Text: It's not false that it's unfair to only refund student debt for those who didn't pay theirs off already. But the answer is, the better thing to do is refund full tuition to everyone who paid it. If that's the alternative being proposed, great.
