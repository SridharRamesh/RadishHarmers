<pre>I think most of school is a waste of time and most teachers aren&#39;t very good, little authoritarians giving kids needless stress. What I don&#39;t understand is why everyone else who claims to feel the same way takes this to mean schools must reopen ASAP must need school now now now.</pre>

<pre>@dan_wickes That&#39;s right, it&#39;s all bullshit, and it&#39;s all in bad faith. I mean, if teachers are lazy, then all the more reason to say, alright, we students might as well skip the commute too, when we get so little out of it.</pre>

<pre>@dan_wickes But David Brooks just wants schools to be a holding pen for kids so their parents can go to an office holding pen for adults, and be diligent worker bees who see their kids in the evening before bed. Health be damned, keep the gears of industry turning, etc etc.</pre>

<pre>@Beach19thSt It&#39;s a weird cultural thing. Parents love their kids too, but we force them to only see their kids in the evenings before bed, and tell them this is moral, and to shy away from this arrangement is immoral. So they develop habits aligned with this and then naturally resent change.</pre>

<pre>The institutional flaws of school aren&#39;t really individual teachers&#39; faults, many teachers are doing their best, the flaws are systematic, blah blah blah of course ofc. But still, if you do think so lowly of teachers as many claim, these things I&#39;m saying should be your position.</pre>

<pre>@horatioalgorthm I think putting it as if things have been &quot;settled&quot; already in Western thought and &quot;Why rehash the settled?&quot; is a bit off the mark, but there is still a gist to this which resonates with me.

But the strongest effect here isn&#39;t income, the strongest effect is Dem/Rep. By far the trait most associated with support for reopening schools in this polling is being Rep.</pre>
