<pre>@swaggy_2_dope Oh, I knew what you meant, but I seized the opportunity to obliquely let women know I am horny, through this pretend misinterpretation. The news must be spread.</pre>

<pre>After dodging bullets left and right on religion, politics, sex, and my hit-and-run 12 years ago, Meltdown May will finally consume me as I bare publicly my feelings about our etiquette custom to just be cool with always coming back from folks&#39; houses covered in their pets&#39; hair.</pre>

<pre>(I was thinking of saving this for the end of May, to give me a little more time with my dear friends on here. But, as I swore to myself to do that night in 2006, we must always accelerate forward to our destiny, not cling to an irrelevant past. Let the Purge begin.)</pre>

<pre>My four month old Macbook keyboard is fucking  up, and this is apparently a common problem. (See, just there, I didn&#39;t intentionally type a double space, it just happened. You have to believe me, these stray spaces are happening constantly,  not my fault, and driving me insane.)</pre>
