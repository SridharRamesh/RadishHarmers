<pre>If I were a mouse, based on the information available to me from cartoons, I would gladly walk into mousetraps. What&#39;s a bit of mouse jail, against the reward of glorious cheese while there? It is for this reason older mice do not let younger mice watch cartoons, not even Mickey.</pre>

<pre>And so you see, the phonetic similarity of &quot;free speech&quot; to the semantically unrelated, and indeed absurd, pair of words &quot;freeze peach&quot; reveals it to have been all along a groundless principle. (Hoist with its own speech petard, as it were.)</pre>

<pre>An accurate and not at all disingenuous argument about history is that countering racism, sexism, homophobia, etc, requires trading away higher taxation and social spending, the welfare state, etc. Can&#39;t have one without the other. Welfare funding comes from homogeneity bucks.</pre>
