Text: RT @RadishHarmers: Don't worry. They're called murder hornets because of how notoriously easy they are to murder.

Text: Before getting to bicycles, I will begin teaching my children to drive an 18-wheeler, so they can get accustomed to the process fear-free, comforted by all those training wheels.

Text: @shreyabasu003 It is an absolutely pointless activity. There is no reason to force children to memorize which small numbers multiply by which small numbers to yield which decimal expansions. All it causes is frustration and resentment of this sort, for no gain.

Text: @shreyabasu003 I've been saying this forever, to no avail. I've been saying it since I was a kid. Anyone who knows what multiplication means can repeatedly add to work such tables out for themselves, if they ever need to. Why force fast rote recall drills? Pointless ritual, like much of school.

Text: @shreyabasu003 Me saying this 8.5 years ago, if anyone wishes to read more than 280 characters. Each time, I get objections like "But how will they grow up to be, like me, a high speed trader without time to type into a calculator?". Learn to type faster then, idiot. https://t.co/TW7GaCHkmd

Text: None specific, but I once asked my mom why the order of times didn't matter; why, e.g., 3 times 5 = 5 times 3, as in 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 5 + 5 + 5. She explained, and that lightbulb was epochally lovely. Cherished memory. Not "mindblowing"; beautifully graspable clarity. https://t.co/jnQZjfqWwj

Text: She said "See this 10 by 10 times table? Go check that each of the hundred entries matches the one you get when you flip the order of the multiplication. It then follows that as you carry out the multiplication algorithm on multi-digit numbers, the same property will persist."

Text: I'm going to die single and unaccomplished and, worst of all, old. For generations hence, people will remember that I was old, and make fun of how pathetically aged and sickly I was. Either that or how grievously injured.
