<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@bridgietherease Yeah. I mean, suburban NJ is less dense than Manhattan, but not worlds apart; half the people there commuted here every day for work up until just now. But it&#39;s true living in a house in the suburbs is different than living in an apartment building in the city, perhaps.</p></blockquote>

But who knows? But I also am very paranoid of being the person to get them sick. I don&#39;t know. Obviously, I love my parents and it&#39;s sweet they love me and are so worried about me.</p></blockquote>
