Text: @wigglin Nothing Marx did advanced the field of mathematics in any significant way. These notes are more a curiosity for seeing how one particular student came to terms with making sense of the differential calculus, at a time when such questions were in the air even among mathematicians.

Text: @wigglin In more detail, there was unease about the sensibility of infinitesimals (as in Newton and Leibniz's account of the differential calculus) dating back at least to Bishop Berkeley's publication of The Analyst. The 0/0 business of (f(x + h) - f(x))/h at h = 0, so to speak.

Text: @wigglin The standard story is that Cauchy, Weierstrass, et al, banished infinitesimals from calculus and put it on solid formal ground with epsilontics, roughly contemporaneously to Marx. Well, epsilontics are just one formal perspective available.

Text: @wigglin There's many perspectives from which to make sense of the original use of infinitesimals in the differential calculus, many perfectly good ways to formalize the rules for dealing with them.

Text: @wigglin It was in this space that Marx was writing, as the hegemony of epsilontics (or any so precisely specified alternative) in explicating calculus would not become so standardized till later, and Marx would've been unaware of Cauchy, Weierstrass, et al's work at the time.
