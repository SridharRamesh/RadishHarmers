<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m talking about, and there&#39;s no reason for me to be talking. How arrogant of me to presume I have any novel or noteworthy insight to bring to bear on the same thing everyone else is already talking about. (And clearly, I don&#39;t). I hope I shut up soon.</p></blockquote>
