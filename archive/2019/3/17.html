<pre>When I&#39;m one of five distinct fake me&#39;s, that&#39;s the real me. My stock of different personas for different audiences and contexts, my box of trademark staples; I reject any obligation to have something yet further on top of that.</pre>

But when I looked in her eyes, well I almost fell for my Lola
Lolololo Lola Lolololo Lola
Lola lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo. Lo. Lo. Lo. Lo. La.
Light of my life, fire of my loins
My sin, my soul
The tip of the tongue taking a trip of 28 steps</pre>

<pre>@haircut_hippie @neoliberal_dad We must not conflate the serenade author with the serenade protagonist. When David Bowie had sex with 14-year-old Lori, it was not meant as an endorsement; he was deliberately portraying himself as a statutory rapist who would next hand her off to be kidnapped by Jimmy Page.</pre>

<pre>So far as ways to be torn go, my favorite is between difficult decisions, such as whether or not to watch the latest ambitious yet flawed film by a talented but problematic creator, that sort of thing, while among my biggest peeves remains limb from limb.</pre>

<pre>@rahuldphys In fairness, the referenced memorization here is but a single bit, and I sympathize with being completely unable to do it. &quot;Type I/II error&quot; is awful terminology people should just replace with &quot;false positive/negative&quot;.</pre>
