<pre>It has only just occurred to me what an amusing coincidence it is for Thierry Coquand to have that name. His first name is like &quot;theory&quot; and his last name is like &quot;Coq&quot;.</pre>

<pre>All the other coronaviruses that aren&#39;t severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and instead just cause, like, stomach upset in chickens or the common cold, must be so jealous. Even SARS 1 is a has-been at this point.</pre>

<pre>There&#39;s some sort of problem with my keyboard where it keeps accidentally deleting words without my realizing it, on top of repeated letters and the like. The terrible butterfly design. I will be taking it to the Apple store tomorrow for repair.</pre>

<pre>There&#39;s no way we maintain shutdown for a year, as some project. Not that the rates of adherence to quarantine are even so high right now, but a year would be unprecedented. People would sooner go around deliberately infecting everyone to bring cautious shutdown to an early end.</pre>

<pre>In the post-Event landscape, mathematical logicians who do comedy, but not much, and don&#39;t do much math, and don&#39;t do much anything, will be most highly prized for their skills. Marauding gangs will compete for their favor. Their sizable harems will be filthy with coronavirus.</pre>

<pre>Losing my mind at this hour. Forcing myself offline for a day or so, to force myself into my lonely head, to think real thoughts for a second. It&#39;s dumb personed that I need to make an announcement to make myself to do this, but I&#39;m a dumb person. I may just be hungry and sleepy.</pre>
