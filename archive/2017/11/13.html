<pre>I rarely play videogames anymore, but the clips of Mario Odyssey look exciting to me, like precisely the game the nostalgia-child in me would get super-excited about. Is it more like Mario 64 (freeform, great!) or Mario Galaxy (on-rails, tedious) though?</pre>

(Aaah, I guess the paranoia that sent me into private mode while job hunting isn&#39;t necessary. Or maybe it is? I can never tell. Anyway, I hereby lift it, but I&#39;ll keep flip-flopping into and out of private mode randomly till employed.)</pre>

<pre>As a kid, I thought Asteroids, with its wraparound, behaved basically like moving around a globe. But later a realization came: in Asteroids-world, some loops of wall (eg, a vertical line down the middle) wouldn&#39;t separate the world in two. Thus, it isn&#39;t like a globe, after all.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe I&#39;ve never been entirely clear on what the 2nd Law really amounts to, anyway. Points of my confusion: What distinguishes a microstate from a macrostate? Is dS ≥ 0 a logical certainty or merely highly highly probable? And what of Loschmidt&#39;s paradox?</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe I&#39;m dimly aware of the arrow of time resolution of &quot;Oh, the Big Bang at one temporal end of things was a situation of very low entropy, distinguishing past from future&quot;. But this doesn&#39;t fill me with the same kind of certainty as I&#39;m given to understand for other physical laws.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe Right, of course, and I thought that too. But because everyone gives these mathematical arguments for it, that ends up warping my perspective on how to think about it. (And as I said, I also have confusion about what entropy is; the microstate vs macrostate distinction involved).</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe We think of GR and QM as describing the behavior of various fundamental forces of the universe. But we think of the 2nd Law in terms of statistical mechanics, so it feels like it should only hold to the extent it indeed arises from other fundamental forces (+ initial conditions).</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence @sigfpe By empirical observation, which as noted is the same for all of these. But those observations then build a model of how the universe functions. In the model I&#39;ve built(/had built for me), there are fundamental interactions like gravity, electricity, etc, which drive everything.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@quasicoherence @sigfpe But there&#39;s no fundamental &quot;2nd Law&quot; force in this model; it&#39;s just something that arises emergently from the other forces. But the story my model tells me for how it arises makes it seem more of a probabilistic thing than an ironclad rule of universe behavior.</pre>
