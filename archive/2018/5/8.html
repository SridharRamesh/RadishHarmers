Mark Rothko&#39;s Basiliskâ€¦ You know how many goddamn Yudkowsky/MIRI/etc jokes I&#39;ve made on this website, languishing unappreciated? Both Musk and Grimes should be dating me.</pre>

<pre>@SirJohnBurrito @vs_cointelpro If he&#39;s inflating his height by 2 inches, there&#39;s a little humor in that, as in various kinds of socially-instilled insecurity, sure, but not enough gas to keep the joke funny THIS long. But I&#39;m also skeptical of the Net&#39;s ability to infer his height down to the very inch anyway.</pre>

<pre>@SirJohnBurrito @vs_cointelpro And as with Trump&#39;s hands and other such, I think people are markedly exaggerating to themselves just how much this particular trite line-of-mockery actually needles the guy; as far as I can tell, all of us are now spending way more time thinking about his height than he does.</pre>
