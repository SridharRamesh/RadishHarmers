Text: There are so many porn video bot replies to every mildly popular post today. And, frankly, they've got some good music. I'm playing it on loop in a minimized window in the background while I study.

Text: For what it's worth, using "literally" as a generic intensifier really makes my blood boil, too. It's truly a plague on the English language. I'm really laid-back on usage peeves in general, but this one actually drives me insane. In fact, it's quite soul-crushing.

Text: I bet some of the friends I knew whose deaths saddened me at the time would've gone on to have bad politics and be frustrating on Facebook.

Text: Please suggest for me new things to think about, which are not politics, myself, or Twitter.

Text: @BlueBear2487 I've been meaning to read Moby Dick, genuinely. I suspect I'll like it much more now than in high school.

Text: @Bookcaterpilla1 I know it's hard not having friends or family nearby. I also recently moved and have few friends in my new city yet, but one must hope that one can make new friends, instead of, like egg cells, having only a fixed and diminishing stock for life.
