Text: @akivaw @asmeurer @karakfa @3blue1brown x! ought be considered defined everywhere, just sometimes infinite.

But the bother with x!/(y! (x - y)!) is, there are points where its limiting value isn't unambiguous over all directions of approach. But it is what it is, that's just the reality of the situation.

Text: @akivaw @asmeurer @karakfa @3blue1brown Specifically, when x is a negative integer and either y or (x - y) is a negative integer. As simplest example, one readily finds paths of approach to -1 choose -1 along which the result approaches either 0 or 1.

Text: @akivaw @asmeurer @karakfa @3blue1brown Consider: (x choose 0) and (x choose x) are both always 1 in the realm where there's no difficulty, and similarly (x choose y) + (x choose y + 1)  = (x + 1 choose y + 1) [the Pascal's triangle identity], but this gives 2 = (-1 choose -1) + (-1 choose 0) = (0 choose 0) = 1.
