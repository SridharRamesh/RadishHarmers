<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is there such a thing as two-way parasociality? I feel like that&#39;s a thing, I feel like that&#39;s the very thing I mostly get out of this site, simulacrum enough to keep me from leaving but not enough to satisfy, but I can&#39;t flesh it out in 280. You get the idea, I&#39;m sure.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@sigfpe @yeetphilosopher I agree with your second sentence, which is how I feel as well. Re: your first sentence, I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re taking issue with my post? I&#39;m not saying they don&#39;t explain why (False, False) goes to False; I&#39;m saying they don&#39;t well generalize beyond illustrating such operators.</p></blockquote>

Though a bit odd to make this argument when you yourself said attempting to do so by listening to such machines actually led to poor decisions about how to apportion campaign resources and funds.
