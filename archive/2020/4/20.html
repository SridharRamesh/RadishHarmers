<pre>@Scrotes3 @xerosome It totally can. You can go make this yourself right now, out of toilet paper or the like. The only thing weird about it is that it&#39;s knotted, in a sense, relative to a normal wall; put another way, you can&#39;t do it without some bottom of the wall passing over some top of the wall.</pre>

<pre>@Scrotes3 @xerosome One other note is that many are calling this a Möbius strip. This is not a Möbius strip. There are two distinct sides to the wall.

It is in itself topologically equivalent to an ordinary cylindrical wall; what is unusual is just the way it is embedded into the ambient space.</pre>

<pre>This is a fun animation, but I&#39;m seeing a lot of discussion calling this either an impossible object or a Möbius strip. Neither of those are correct. You can go make this yourself right now out of a stretch of toilet paper or such. And you&#39;ll see it maintains two distinct sides. https://t.co/aV4TelELjm</pre>

<pre>(This is different than if you take a rubber band which ALREADY has height, and twist it into a figure 8. If you do that, you will find that walking along the top of the band will bring you to the bottom within the twist, then back to the top. That is not the case for this wall.</pre>

<pre>It is just the same as if you took a loop of thin wire, twisted it into a figure 8 lemniscate (one part of the wire passing over another at the crossing point), and then thickened the wire into sheets of rock with height and a bit of depth.</pre>

<pre>The actual unusual thing is the way this wall is embedded into ambient space. That is, it&#39;s knotted, in a certain sense, relative to a normal wall. Some bottom of the wall passes over some top of the wall, and you can&#39;t move it around to undo this without tearing and regluing.</pre>

<pre>Indeed, the connectivity relations between the bricks of this wall (which corners and edges and faces of which bricks are glued to which other ones) are exactly the same as for an ordinary circular wall!</pre>

<pre>The two distinct sides would&#39;ve been more manifest in the animation too, if some asymmetric figure such as a person facing out the window was used, rather than symmetric pots. You&#39;d see this person always facing the same way when they came to the same point.</pre>

<pre>Still, it&#39;s a perfectly possible, simple-to-build object. It&#39;s interesting how this simple thing you can go make yourself is still so strikingly unusual and impossible-feeling to the brain.</pre>

<pre>@Scrotes3 @xerosome No. It has two distinct sides. Imagine a guy facing out one window. When he returns to the same point, he faces the same way. Or imagine an ant crawling around on one side of the wall. It will never end up on the other side (unless it crawls over the top or under the bottom!).</pre>

<pre>@Scrotes3 @xerosome No, an ant crawling around on a Möbius strip will touch both sides.

You could color this wall continuously with one side red and the other side blue. You can&#39;t do that with a Möbius strip. https://t.co/ZFnstMxwkt</pre>

<pre>Yes, students can just as well memorize the solutions to x^2 - 1 = 0 as ±1. But are they also to memorize a formula for x^2 - 4 = 0 as ±2, and separately a formula for x^2 - 5 = 0 as ±√5, etc? Far better to understand a general method. This is the value of the quadratic formula. https://t.co/6xnl4eCqVL</pre>

<pre>I&#39;m going to keep reposting this every day till people aware of every fact about the Kitty Genovese case except for that she wasn&#39;t actually murdered at 7 PM stop telling me the facts of the Kitty Genovese case they think I am unaware of. I&#39;m aware.</pre>

<pre>The character &quot;I&quot; in my posts could be anyone. It is not autobiographical. He is simply an archetype, for any man or woman who is dumb and has all my particular flaws.</pre>

<pre>As a kid, I didn&#39;t get why ancient explorers were so keen to find a fountain of youth. Wouldn&#39;t you want to grow up, to do cool stuff like driving? But as I aged, I realized, cars didn&#39;t exist yet. Naturally, you&#39;d want to extend your life, to be around when they invent driving.</pre>

<pre>I am possibly the only person in the world who had been watching Future Man, but it is shockingly good. Far exceeds the low expectations I had after the first episode and looking up the creators&#39; other projects (Sausage Party?), in both ultimate ambition and just plain funniness.</pre>

<pre>Life adapts to quarantine and goes on, mutatis mutandis. Now I&#39;m constantly worried I&#39;ve left the oven on whenever I leave the kitchen for the bedroom.</pre>

<pre>Heterodox scholars subscribing to the converse Barcan formula are demanding that I continue to exist, but refuse to provide me the proper PPE to safely do so.</pre>
