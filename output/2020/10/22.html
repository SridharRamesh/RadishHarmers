Text: I don't think acting like a dog in public is really so explicit or horrible or tough to explain to kids. "That guy's a weirdo. He likes to act like a dog". Kids won't put together it's a sex thing. It's basically Improv Everywhere. However, for this reason, it is dumb.

Text: Get some standards. You can't be dunking on a 2K tweet from an 800 followers poster, no matter how dumb it is. You're dunking on that which barely exists. Sometimes people say dumb things. It happens too often to be noteworthy. I've broken this rule myself, because I too am dumb.
