Text: Carefully devising and promoting a sabermetric stat that will establish me as the most valuable baseball star of all time, quantifying my morale-boosting fandom for my favored team, my wearing of lucky underwear through the World Series, the financial support I provide, etc.

Text: I don't care what anyone says, Barry Bonds rightfully belongs in the Hall of Fame, alongside Barbara Walters, Pelé, Alexander Fleming, and the Taj Mahal. All quite famous.

Text: @Discourse_Stu For what it's worth, people often discuss the phenomenon in this thread under the name "Keynesian beauty contest", in case you want to look up more people talking about it. But yeah, I agree; our world is set up stupidly.

Text: @ModelOfTheory Certainly, you get a complex vector space from any real vector space this way (taking scaling by i to be differentiation). But is it possible to see each complex vector space as isomorphically arising in this fashion, in a natural way (e.g., without picking a basis via Choice)?

Text: Look, officer, how many times do you need it explained? I WAS following the rules of the road. "STOP", the sign demanded, so I took my hands off the wheel and foot from the brake, to cease active work. …Aah, you're useless! We are at an impasse. Let us consult rabbinical law.

Text: Man, how does everyone time it so perfectly on their deathbed, managing to finish their last words before going out? Lying back, proudly smiling and waiting. When I die, it'll be an interruption. Print my valedictory without the closing quotation mark I won't have made it to.

Text: A) I'm aware Jonny hasn't written for BoJack yet; I'm just saying the sensibilities aren't far off.
B) The point of this post isn't to put down BoJack or Jonny. My personal tastes are mercurial and irrelevant, except in that I also sometimes indulge expressing pseudoprofundities.

Text: Folks gnashed teeth at BoJack hiring Jonny, finding him grating for posting pseudoprofundities. Yet they also go gaga raving about the eulogy episode, which was, to my mind, for better or worse, just the sort of thing sad mood Jonny might write. The sensibilities aren't far off.

Text: Though he was extrapolating from contemporary trends, still, Orwell could never have imagined that, as we now know, the horror described in his fictional dystopia "Nineteen Eighty-Four" would come to be all-too-real a mere three and a half decades later.
