Text: All I want to say is that anybody who's terrified of the possibility of the "Boy Bye" wallpaper sweeping the Democratic primaries better vote, better get active, better get involved, because this entity has got some momentum. I'm telling you, stranger things have happened.

Text: Pretending 34 is a round or culturally significant milestone number, so I can justify flipping out with doleful reflection and midlife crisis over my impending 34th birthday.

Text: @rogerbellin @Trillburne A shame, that guy wasted his talents playing anything other than basketball. Could've been huge.

Text: @_gabriel_U I don't quite follow what you mean by saying 34 is a "factor thereof", but my condolences on your 37th year (the worst thing that ever happened to me happened almost precisely on my 19th birthday) and I thank you for the good wishes.

Text: @_gabriel_U 17 * 2 isn't a prime multiplied by a non-prime; it's a prime multiplied by another prime. I'll note that every number is a product of sufficiently many primes. But if we are to say something notable about 34 in this capacity, we may at least say it is a prime times a SMALL value.
