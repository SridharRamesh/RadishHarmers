<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just ate a prepackaged &quot;spicy chickpea lettuce wrap&quot; thing at PHX, cuz I&#39;m an idiot, so now I&#39;m convinced I&#39;ll die in a week. I didn&#39;t even eat the lettuce, I just wanted the chickpeas. And it was labelled &quot;iceberg&quot;. Still, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll die. That&#39;s generally how it goes for me.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I even have a packed home-cooked lunch; that&#39;s how dumb I am. (Just trying to save that for later, in flight. Just trying to waste money and sit on toilets more.)</p></blockquote>
