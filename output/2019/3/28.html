Text: @Clueless73 I never said they were MÃ¶bius strips; my only claim is that these are how MÃ¶bius (and Listing) cut their own bagels ðŸ˜€. But note that the two interlocking halves aren't ordinary bagel halves; each is a double half-twist (as opposed to the familiar single half-twist) MÃ¶bius strip.

Text: @Clueless73 You CAN also cut a bagel into a familiar single half-twist MÃ¶bius strip in the same way, but then you get one long connected piece, instead of two separate disconnected ones.

Text: @funtimewfennecs Yours are among the rare few critques of the guy I see on this site that have given me genuine pause

(That having been said, there's quite a difference between six years old and six months old.)

Text: @SeanRMoorhead That might be what it is, I'm not sure. If not a bug, per se, it is at least poor design to not clarify the situation for the user. There's no reason we should struggle to figure these things out for ourselves; that opaqueness doesn't have to be how software works.

Text: @ConnorSouthard @badkuthi69 The story of the nerd originates in the Detroit area circa 1950; there is also an appearance in Seuss's "If I Ran the Zoo" (also published in 1950), but it is difficult to explain this as other than a coincidental homonym, unconnected to the relevant current sense.
