Text: @quasicoherence @PRDGM1 Yes, there are theorems of this sort. For example, any first-order statement about natural number arithmetic (equivalently, any first-order statement about hereditarily finite sets) which can be proven in ZFC (i.e., with Zorn) can be proven as well in ZF (i.e., without Zorn).

Text: @quasicoherence @PRDGM1 I don't know if "first-order" is a concept that's widely known outside logic or not, but what this amounts to in this context is, statements built up from Boolean connectives, computable functions/relations, and universal or existential quantifiers ranging over N or V_ ω.

Text: @quasicoherence @PRDGM1 Proof: The inner model L always satisfies ZFC even if the ambient model V only satisfies ZF, yet N or V_ω relativized to L is unchanged from the ambient model's "true" N or V_ω.

We can go further and note that axioms like Foundation also make no difference to statements about N.

You should see the other guy! I gave as good as I got. An unusually large insect; grasshopper, I think? Anyway, it was close.

Text: My tremendous personal charisma only kicks in after I've met a new person a few times already. The first couple times, it's all guarded shyness and aloof laconicity. Third time's the charm.

Text: Spotting a "Greatest Hits" album among my friend's library, I turn up my nose. How gauche! How unrefined! Luckily, I've brought some records from my own collection. A true music buff, I put on "Just the Filler" followed by "Widely Panned", with "Dross, Utter Dross" ready on deck.

Text: [Sensing that people are unhappy with the president]
If elected president, I promise to do everything in my power to make life miserable for the president, by any means necessary. Vote me in and I swear, I will never permit the president a moment's peace, mentally nor physically.

Text: @PRDGM1 @sigfpe @quasicoherence Zorn's lemma being false doesn't require all sets to be measurable, though the converse is true. Out of curiosity, though, why do you find it annoying for all sets to be measurable? It seems very natural for many to instead be annoyed by the existence of non-measurable sets!

Text: @PRDGM1 @sigfpe @quasicoherence (At any rate, at any moment, you can work within the framework most natural and pleasing to the moment's context: using Zorn's lemma in contexts where it is natural, taking all sets to be measurable in other contexts where that is instead natural, and so on and so on.

Yes, I agree, a certain fraction of mathematics is brainwashing.

I mean, you can see the board from different angles, that's kinda cool. Rooks look wicked from the 7th standard side. Still, expected more…
