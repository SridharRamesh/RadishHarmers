<pre>Nice. Just independently reinvented a joke I saw Louis CK do eight years ago, using a Chinese wall/clean room design, and can now incorporate it into my act.</pre>

<pre>@disableist @trashage @viperwave The Poincaré conjecture has already been proven, in 2006. It was the ensuing freeing up of mental energy which in fact led to the flourishing of the early 2010s Internet.</pre>

<pre>@thejessicaraven I grant that one might worry about an analogy to how, for example, bosses oppose paying workers by disingenuously saying &quot;Let&#39;s not taint our friendship with money talk…&quot;. But I stand by what I said, both this post and the ones that followed it.</pre>

<pre>@thejessicaraven Granted, I don&#39;t have any friends, so I may misunderstand how it works. Perhaps it is true what Burns claimed in his 1989 dissertation contra Albright, that a man and a woman cannot be friends but only can engage in transactional relation.</pre>

<pre>@primordialstew @thejessicaraven My earnest position is that murder is unjust, I am not happy that women &amp;amp; femmes are ever murdered by their male partners, it is horrifying, and paying money to friends for being friends will not put any dent in this injustice.</pre>
