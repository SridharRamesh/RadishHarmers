Text: Corona was for me what Trump was for others, what OJ Simpson once was, what every comic seeks. A bottomless comedic patron, my Medici, my muse, the gift that kept giving. I shall miss it dearly.

Text: I have no idea what my parents' voices actually sound like; what their accent is or such. I've been hearing their voices since before all other sounds. They are the ur-voices. My parents' voices bypass all phonological processing and go directly to the meaning center of my brain.

Text: @NathanBLawrence @rajandelman I can easily believe people would refer to Flavor Aid generically by the more popular brand name Kool-Aid, though. I will hold out until I see footage of actual Kool-Aid present.
