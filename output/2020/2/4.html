Text: Go ahead. Check any poll. The reported margin of error will be 98% divided by the square root of the sample size. There's something mathematically of note about this inverse square root, but it has no magic power to bind reality or future. Of course it doesn't.

Text: "Margin of error" on polls isn't what you think. Generally, it just means 98% divided by the square root of the number of people polled. There's a reason statisticians care about this calculation, but frankly, it's misleading terminology and not at all easy to interpret or apply.

Text: Pedantically, if you see a reported margin of error where this isn't the case, it's because sometimes polls make some people's votes count more than others ("raking", reweighting votes to counter demographic proportions mismatch between their samples and the population at large).

Text: In this case the "margin of error" becomes 98% times the square root of the sum of the squared proportion of the poll result each individual is responsible for. (In the equal weight case, this reduces to the formula from before.)

This is much less common, and no more magical.

Text: The sole thing this "margin of error" describes is an average level of reality mismatch for polls of such size to hit due to random samples happening, unluckily, by pure coincidence, to be unrepresentative.

But this is generally not where poll-to-reality mismatch comes from.

Text: The influence of question wording details, non-random bias in respondent selection, people changing their minds between polls and elections, people not reporting or even having access to their true dispositions when answering polls, etc, are all uncaptured by "margin of error".

Text: On the flip side, though, contra common complaint, note that there's truly no great reason to want a poll's sample size to be of any particular scale in comparison to the population size, to give it credence. All that essentially matters is the sample size in absolute terms.

Text: If you toss darts at true random and tally the proportion which land in the ocean, all that matters for calculating the odds this number differs from Earth overall's by any particular amount is the actual percent of the Earth that's ocean, and how many darts you toss.

Text: If you want to estimate what percent of Earth is ocean, toss a bunch of darts at Earth and see how many land in ocean. Does the number of darts tossed need to be proportional to how many points there are on Earth? How many points are on Earth? Meaningless.

Text: @2cdotRon This is an exhaustive list of numbers M = 4N - 1 for whole numbers N &gt; 2 such that:

N + the product of any two consecutive whole numbers never has a factor less than N.

Equivalently, N + the product of any two consecutive whole numbers smaller than N is always prime.

Text: @2cdotRon Equivalently, M + any square number never has an odd factor less than N.

Equivalently, M has no square factors and the values of the form x = p + q sqrt(-M), where 2p and |x|^2 are whole numbers, have unique factorization into "prime" values analogously to ordinary numbers.

I've probably made a typo somewhere above. Forgive me.

Text: @eponysterical If anyone wants to sway me from my feelings, they should show me the actionable value of these magic model number vomit tables. The action they are led to take that they wouldn't otherwise take, resulting in their life being better than it otherwise would be.

Text: @rogerbellin I must acknowledge that this mere reference joke is precisely the same kind of bad as the overlauded BoJack one I criticized yesterday, only pitched for an xkcd crowd rather than a Twitter crowd. Don't worry. I hate myself. https://t.co/Y1xCMJloZZ
