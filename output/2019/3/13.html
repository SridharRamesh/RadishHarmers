Text: @tommyxtopher I know it's not using the slur, but I've always wondered (in a not at all disingenuous, unfair way) why a person would chose to tweet that word, when not tweeting it would do just as well. https://t.co/FcDtFFNOjl https://t.co/NWiwSutK6b

Text: When Harvard turned me down at the end of high school, rather than taking their offer right away, I chose to defer the rejection, spending a few gap years backpacking in the northeast.

Only 15k, eh? You done fucked up. You're mine now, motherfucker.

Text: @sigfpe Let P be a program which searches for a PA proof of "P terminates", and terminates just in case it finds such a proof.

We will show that P does indeed terminate:

Text: @sigfpe Let X be a program which searches for a PA proof of "If X terminates, then P terminates", and terminates just in case it finds such a proof.

Now observe (alas, Twitter character count restrictions are really frustrating for discussing math...):

Text: @sigfpe If X terminates, then PA proves "If X terminates, then P terminates". Also, if X terminates, trivially, PA can prove "X terminates". Conjoining these, we see that if X terminates, then PA proves "P terminates", which furthermore would imply that P does in fact terminate.

So…

Text: @sigfpe We've now proven that if X terminates, then P terminates. This simple proof can be carried out in PA, so PA proves "If X terminates, then P terminates". This causes X to indeed terminate. Which implies, by the reasoning of the previous paragraph, that P does indeed terminate. QED

Text: @sigfpe [Also tremendously frustrating for discussing math in any detail on Twitter: lack of editing. Each time I want to correct a typo in an early post in a thread, I am forced to manually one-by-one delete each following post as well, and then one-by-one repost them, fragilely. Argh!]

Text: @sigfpe You may wonder: Ok, if P terminates, it must be because it finds some PA proof of P's termination. What's the proof it finds?

And the answer: It depends on the particular search-strategy P uses, but unless something else pops up first: it finds the proof given above, duh.

Text: @sigfpe Put somewhat more strongly: the above is a constructive proof of "P will terminate due to the existence of a PA proof that P will terminate". And, when worked through, we find that the PA proof of P's termination that this constructively establishes to exist is… itself.

Text: @sigfpe Under a proofs as programs correspondence, this is closely related to the Y combinator (as you yourself once saw in your blog). And, as noted in the previous thread, a categorified version of this was the subject of my half-written PhD thesis. Someday I'll find time to finish wri

Text: @sigfpe The proof above depends on being able to straightforwardly make a program X which, by design, terminates just in case one's proof system proves that X's termination entails P's termination.

Text: @sigfpe Whatever techniques one might hope to use in Agda to create such an X as first step, they would presumably work just as well regardless of what not-yet-known-to-terminate program was put in place of P.

Text: @sigfpe If the resulting X for an arbitrary not-yet-known-to-terminate P was then, as a valid Agda program, guaranteed to terminate, it would follow shortly that arbitrary (n-y-k-t-t) P would also be provable within Agda to terminate, contra the soundness of Agda's termination checking.
