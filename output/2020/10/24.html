Text: @tinybaby Instead of talking in terms of marginal tax rates, people should just show the graph of post-tax income as a function of pre-tax income. Everything is obvious on the graph.

Text: @htpyFiber @Category_Fury It's a historical accident but so are most elements of notation and terminology. It's a historical accident that we call the integers after the letter zee at all.

Text: @Irish_Atheist @yarbsalocin If joking about Hitler and Nazis is fine, why would joking about Holocaust deniers be off limits? Not that the rest of the world ever agreed to only make jokes Mel Brooks made, in any case.

Text: @yarbsalocin @Irish_Atheist I was willing to let it just die but I appreciate your defending me on the obvious point that saying words can mean something other than literally endorsing them. For example, Irish Atheist says here "The Holocaust did not happen". https://t.co/lXIiGcaSaf

Text: @MuddyPenguins @yarbsalocin @Irish_Atheist He doesn't come from Jewish ancestry and he doesn't believe in the Jewish religion, so, I don't know. Not that I think it matters, but maybe the high horse is a bit undeserved. He's converted to Judaism (in some racial consubstantiation ritual) only for the joke-scolding.

Text: @MuddyPenguins @yarbsalocin @Irish_Atheist Obviously, we feel differently about jokes. You are perfectly free to not like these jokes, of course. I would not say these jokes to you as I know you would not care for them. So I did not. I said this joke to my followers who like such jokes.

Text: @MuddyPenguins @yarbsalocin @Irish_Atheist It's a bit irritating to be threatened with violence simply for making a quote-parallelism silly logic joke on how Holocaust deniers can be dumb, but I also know the threats are meaningless, no biggie.

All the best. Have a good weekend.

Text: Sort of a throwback, standup all went the other way. This honestly doesn't feel so different from Russell Peters type stuff that was all the rage when I was in college. Maybe I'm just sympathetic because my mother also married an Indian guy. https://t.co/kqYuwVyr7K

Text: Made up enemies in my head will say "Sridhar, who are you to complain? You make risque jokes all the time. You're always saying people only complain when it's just their ox that got gored, you hypocrite". I agree. I just can't buy the premise that Native Americans committed 9/11.
