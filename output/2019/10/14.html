Text: I have accepted a position as ethnicity reviewer for a major coastal publication, a paper of record, a paper which, one might say, has "all the news" that's "fit" to "print". Look forward to my rankings soon. Some may surprise you!

Text: I don't care what anyone says, Barry Bonds rightfully belongs in the Hall of Fame, alongside Catherine the Great, Pel√©, Neil Armstrong, and the Taj Mahal. All quite famous.

Text: Columbus, you dolt! We were to go to India, for its wonderful spices. Black pepper! The mouth waters! Instead, you've steered us way off, you dummy, you goddamn moron, you colossal historical blunderer. Nothing here but this useless "chili". What're we gonna say when we get back?
