<pre>I couldn&#39;t pronounce my name until rather late in life (among other issues, I couldn&#39;t make the &quot;sh&quot; sound until middle school, ultimately fixed by tongue surgery.). In retrospect, it&#39;s odd this wasn&#39;t a cause of more embarrassment. I should have been more embarrassed as a child.</pre>

<pre>This tweet is a lie which struck me as a funny idea (though, ugh, &quot;I&#39;m not white, that&#39;s my whole set, just noting that I&#39;m not white…&quot; is a popular genre I find increasingly tedious. But I think there&#39;s still something funny to this idea.). The shameful truth is exposed below:</pre>

<pre>@johncarlosbaez Sounds like you don&#39;t just mean ZF minus the axiom of infinity; rather, you mean ZF minus the axiom of infinity plus the negation of the axiom of infinity. (After all, any model of ZF is already a model of ZF minus the axiom of infinity.)</pre>

<p>
<pre>@johncarlosbaez Yeah. I&#39;m just being pedantic. When saying ZF - infinity is &quot;basically the same as PA&quot;, this suggests a 1:1 correspondence between their models. But for this we&#39;ll need the former to only have models where all sets are hereditarily finite; otherwise the correspondence isn&#39;t full.</pre>
