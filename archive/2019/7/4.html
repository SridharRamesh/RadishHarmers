<pre>When Kamala Harris grandstanded against Joe Biden in proud support of busing, it was due to her long-standing commitment to the concept of going back and forth between distant positions. https://t.co/Km2rnAlDCs</pre>

<pre>If I disagree with you on something, it doesn&#39;t mean I hate you. And if you hate me? Hey, listen, I don&#39;t disagree.</pre>

<pre>Pummeled by seismic waves, Los Angeles lies in ruins. The entertainment industry needs to rebuild, desperately replacing the talent lost to earthen mass graves. Now is my chance.</pre>

<pre>Holiday relevance bump. Take advantage of your leisurely day off work, kick your feet up, and watch a sketch about the American Revolution, as is our national tradition. Look, you indolent lot, I made it so you don&#39;t even have to click to another site anymore. https://t.co/GB6Ms3lOHr</pre>

<pre>@swissidealism Precedence is precedence, regardless of deletion; would we deny Diogenes or Timon their due, simply for losing their works? The priority is yours, and I will acknowledge it hereout.</pre>

<pre>To be clear, I didn&#39;t write this, or have any part in it other than correctly saying &quot;That&#39;s funny&quot; at an early stage of its development. Alas, I have no idea how to get people to like proper filmed sketches better than the half-to-zero-assed texts I toss off that do numbers.</pre>

<pre>With impeccable posture, I make my way towards Bethlehem to be born. My skin silky smooth, though, heh, now that you mention it, I suppose I AM a beast at some activities…</pre>

<pre>Perry Mason wringing confessions out of everyone. A confession from the accused. Another confession, for another crime, from the witness. From the judge. Each member of the jury. Himself. The murder victim.</pre>

<pre>It&#39;s no longer 2006, in which filming and sharing sketches online remained a viable possibility, but it&#39;s past peak Twitter now too. In 2029, no one&#39;s going to want to read a firehose of random pithy and less-pithy sentences. Maybe vaudeville will come back. Maybe comedic novels.</pre>

<pre>@Bodyisturd You may not be aware of this, and I&#39;m not keen to have clear links between my Twitter/comedic persona and my professional persona, but I did make videos for a very popular math video channel for a time. The guy who runs that probably will get written up as a new kind of educator.</pre>
