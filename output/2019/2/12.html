Text: Surely, your honour, there must be something I can do to bolster my defence? Anything, to earn the mercy of the court‚Ä¶ ANYTHING.

[Cut to next morning. I stumble around searching for my trousers in an unfamiliar flat, all the while coughing up fibres from a powdered wig merkin.]

Text: At last, after such careful planning, I break into the celebrity A-list, the Hollywood inner sanctum. I take a moment to steady myself on the bully pulpit, then launch my spree, cancelling stars left and right, before ultimately, as police close in, turning the cancel on myself.

Text: @htmlmencken Jokes about prison rape are shitty and make light of a horrific trauma which no one deserves, not even those who have committed crimes of their own.

Text: @rogerbellin @ByYourLogic @lushperson Hardly the first, though. There were various such moments before; e.g., a big Twitter flap last summer about AOC's waffly comments on Israel/Palestine (see https://t.co/j0uuU7SssB). No one really remembers it anymore, though (not even me, in detail); she'd been doing well since.

Text: @ModelOfTheory Yes, I was worried about this ruining the joke, which is why I tried covering my ass with "fully cardinal".
