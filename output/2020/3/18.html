Text: @bridgietherease Yeah. I mean, suburban NJ is less dense than Manhattan, but not worlds apart; half the people there commuted here every day for work up until just now. But it's true living in a house in the suburbs is different than living in an apartment building in the city, perhaps.

Text: @bridgietherease They want to drive over to pick me up (not taking any trains), but I feel like that's probably still going to be a possibility for a while; even the shelter-in-place orders in the Bay Area, etc, haven't closed highways, have they?

Text: @bridgietherease And I don't think they'll need me unless things get so bad that suddenly they themselves are sick. But who knows? But I also am very paranoid of being the person to get them sick. I don't know. Obviously, I love my parents and it's sweet they love me and are so worried about me.

Text: (Not that this part matters, but finishing my abandoned thesis for personal closure is not a wild idea, but certainly isn't going to happen right now during these conditions. Being shut in without normal socialization release is ùëöùëúùëüùëí distracting than just having normal life.)

Text: Honestly, nothing much has changed for me. Even in my normal life, I just stayed at home a lot, avoided crowds, coughed excessively, had difficulty breathing, ran a fever, built up fluid, permanently lost 20 to 30% of lung function, and died.

Text: I can't gauge the right level of concerned to be. At first I wasn't worried, and didn't change any habits, then I came to feel that was foolish. Now I'm much more worried, and rigorously quarantining, but given how many people I see walking around, maybe that's foolish.
