&quot;Those aren&#39;t four zeros. They&#39;re two infinities.&quot;</pre>

<pre>Mastodon also bans people for problematic content; in fact, it appears to be a keystone of its raison d&#39;etre. So, good luck in a few years when a fifth of your faves get booted from https://t.co/kiJEEPMGQO for falling on the wrong side of its admins&#39; civility determinations, too.</pre>

<pre>So the guy loves prime polynomials; who doesn&#39;t? The fact that R[X] is a Euclidean domain for any field R, and still a unique factorization domain even if R is merely a UFD (thus extending in the same way to arbitrarily many variables) is one of the great beauties of mathematics.</pre>

<pre>An interesting exercise in math for those (especially non-mathematicians) who haven&#39;t thought about it before is this: Why is the factorization of whole numbers into products of prime numbers unique? Why couldn&#39;t two different bunches of primes multiply to the same thing?</pre>

<pre>@rogerbellin In some sense, sure, but I think this particular fact sits at an especially interesting point in the contrast between the certainty with which laypeople are made aware of it, and yet the lack of awareness, even upon reflection, of certain neighboring phenomena undergirding it.</pre>

<pre>@martsendo One thing to keep in mind is that this proposed argument didn&#39;t use the assumption of being prime anywhere, so it couldn&#39;t have worked. (For if it had worked, it would&#39;ve just as well shown that 2 * 6 couldn&#39;t equal 3 * 4.)</pre>
