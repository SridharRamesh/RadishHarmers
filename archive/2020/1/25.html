<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath Surely lots of people do, or at any rate, refrain from saying the &quot;real&quot; Set must be classical. &quot;Set&quot; is a marker for the category of sets in whatever metalogic you wish to use. When your metalogic is intuitionistic, then the internal logic of Set has intuitionistic logic.</p></blockquote>

[There may be some confusion caused by people often speaking of choice, LEM, etc, in toposes in an &quot;external&quot; sense by default, but what&#39;s relevant for this conversation is the internal logic, and really, that&#39;s what these should all mean by default anyway]</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath The subobject classifier will be the powerset of the one element set, and this definitely will not be isomorphic to the two-element set in an intuitionistic set theory such as IZF. In that sense, the internal logic is intuitionistic, not classical.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath And in terms of the internal exponential, (1 + 1)^1 = 1 + 1 is a tautology, so every topos is automatically internally two-valued in the Hom(1, 1 + 1) = 1 + 1 sense.<br><br>The only substantive internal question is whether the &amp;lt;True, False&amp;gt; map from 1 + 1 to Ω is an isomorphism.]</p></blockquote>
