Text: @ModelOfTheory Inversion in the sense of negation? But why focus on 2-ary inversion, and not 3-ary inversion (where a, wa, and w^2a are considered a triple of 3-ary inverses, for w a primitive 3rd root of unity), or whatever n-ary thing. Perhaps this is circular too…

Text: @FrankieG_Baby Sure, one could imagine a framework in which we postulated some first (or otherwise canonical) transfinitely far digit after all the finitely far ones, such that something like this is to happen. But that's not the framework I intend to be describing.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby The framework I intend (known technically as the "10-adics", should such names matter to anyone) is where we only consider digits finitely far from the start.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby It's a different framework than the familiar one, and in considering whether its outcomes "make sense", one oughtn't interpret those results in the familiar way. Its outcomes make perfect sense on their own terms.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby As I said, it's used to study cyclic phenomena; e.g., in considering angles, it is indeed the case that making lots of turns in one direction is eventually as good as turning the other way. In such contexts, it's very sensible to take a large sum of positives to equal a negative.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby You can't have a negative or fractional number of children, but the concepts of negatives or fractions have their uses elsewhere, and similarly with the 10-adics.)

Text: @FrankieG_Baby Not to mention (again much like with negatives or fractions) there are many results about plain-ordinary arithmetic which are most easily seen by going through intermediary thoughts from the perspective of 10-adic arithmetic. Everything's connected.

Text: @ModelOfTheory A group being a monoid with a function f such that f^2(x) = x and x * f(x) = 1.

But similarly, we may consider "troupes", a troupe being a monoid with an f such that f^3(x) = x and x * f(x) * f^2(x) = 1. (And so on for any n, naturally).

Text: @ModelOfTheory So might we (I am genuinely pondering this) consider focus on groups instead of n-troupes similarly a circular sneaking in of fake specialness of 2?

Text: @ModelOfTheory Tangentially, I've often been curious when and by who in history the realization that permutations carry parity was first discovered. I'd usually attributed it to Cauchy in the 1810s, but it seems at least implicit in Cramer's discussion of his eponymous rule 70 years earlier.

Text: @ModelOfTheory Yes, but what is an automorphism group? A collection of endomorphism tuples (m_1, m_2) such that m_1 * m_2 = m_2 * m_1 = 1, composing under the rule (m_1, m_2) * (n_1, n_2) = (m_1 * n_1, n_2 * m_2).

But perhaps a 2 has been snuck in here implicitly…

Text: @ModelOfTheory In non-abelian context, it's tricky to see what an automorphism troupe should be, but in a context where everything commutes, we might consider an automorphism troupe to be a collection of triples (m_1, m_2, m_3) satisfying m_1 * m_2 * m_3 = 1, composing component-wise.

Text: @ModelOfTheory The specialness of 2 might then be that we could make sense of this even without requiring everything to commute, but 2 wouldn't quite get specialness over the concept entirely.

Text: @Subb4k @ModelOfTheory This generalizes: Any field of characteristic p has its p-th roots of unity (in its algebraic closure) all equal. (But the fact that every field already contains -1 without need for further closure is precisely the fact that the 2nd primitive root of unity is already an integer.)

Text: @ModelOfTheory Alright, now the 2 comes from your focus on "functions"; that is, on particular 2-ary relations. But we might also look at 3-ary correspondence relations. E.g., R(x, y, z), such that for any choice of x, y, or z, there are designated corresponding values for the other arguments.

Text: @ModelOfTheory Note that we can compose these 3-ary correspondences in the various ways that 3-simplices can be put together to make new 3-simplices, just as we could compose our familiar 2-ary correspondences in the various ways that 2-simplices can be put together to make new 2-simplicies.

Text: @ModelOfTheory Of course, there's a simplicity to 2, which wanes with higher n. This is the fact that 2 is smaller than higher n. 2 is special in being minimal among the cardinals bigger than 1, yes…

Text: @ModelOfTheory Put another way, an isomorphism groupoid, like any groupoid, can be just as well viewed simplicially. And so a group, traditionally thought of only in terms of the 1-cells (2-point simplices) of a fixed object, just as well gives rise to n-simplices for all n.

Text: @ModelOfTheory The 2-simplices come with 2-ary inversion (like turning a line around); the 3-ary simplices come with 3-ary rotations and reflections (like turning or flipping a triangle); the 4-ary simplices come with all the permutations of a tetrahedron, etc.

Text: @ModelOfTheory It's only for simplicity and minimalism that we choose to focus on the 2-ary structure primarily (in terms of which everything else can be described, yes, just as n-ary compositions can be described via 2-ary ones, but which needn't be considered the exclusive presentation…).

Text: @ModelOfTheory Yes, that's correct. Consider every directed edge of a triangle to be an ordinary automorphism (with the two opposite directions along an edge being ordinary inverses).

Text: @ModelOfTheory You can alternatively phrase this in 2-ish ways if you like, but you can phrase anything in lots of ways. It's not fundamentally a 2-ish notion, except in that each 3-point simplex contains within it 2-simplices for its sides, and so on.
