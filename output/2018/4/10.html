Text: Looking forward to doing my taxes: a straightforward task which will readily and easily be finished, filling me with a minor sense of accomplishment and lessening of obligations. It's like dessert. In putting it off, I am prudently saving it for a moment when I need a pick-me-up.

Text: @NewSovietPoster Uh, I think you're confusing him with either the Jim Davis who owns New Balance, or possibly the Jim Davis who founded Allegis Group, both of whom have net worths in that territory. The Garfield guy is rich, but not THAT rich (more like $800 million).

Text: Everyone makes fun of escape rooms, but I like them. I'm considered a ringer at the sport. Put me on a team, even one made of strangers, and the group will work like hell to extricate themselves from the room as fast as possible. I motivate folks to push themselves to their best.
