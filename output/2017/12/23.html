Text: @Boringstein @shujaxhaider Second "Peep Show", as hard as one can second an opinion.

(But then, I'm also the only person in God's green earth who enjoyed and admired the fourth season of Arrested Development, so my tastes may not line up with yours. Luckily, Peep Show is nothing like Arrested Development)

Text: @shujaxhaider @Boringstein Since you like Peep Show, you may enjoy other things those creators worked on, like The Thick of It (possibly the only good political sitcom of anytime recently; the proto-Veep if you want the Americanized version) and the movie Four Lions (it's great; a top five movie for me).

Text: @Boringstein @dancrowley @shujaxhaider "ambitious" is exactly right. They knew stream-bingeing and rewatching, rather than weekly releases, would change the nature of the show they could make, and they took strong advantage of it, in a way that few other comedies had or still have yet attempted.

Text: @shujaxhaider @Boringstein Yup, I agree that Veep is weaker than The Thick of It (Veep's early seasons were still enjoyable in their own way for me, but by now, it's utterly run out of steam and made bizarre cartoons of every character).
