<pre>@kathbarbadoro It is, and yet my mother and her sister both married men with the same name as their youngest brother. I dunno, I guess he was a real sexy younger brother.</pre>

<pre>@oppenfailer I like him, but it&#39;s become clear talking about comedy is his true passion, what he was working towards and has now successfully moved on to, the way others pursue standup just to get a foot in the door towards an acting career or whatever.</pre>

<pre>@bombsfall @haircut_hippie I did the &quot;The New Testament...&quot; thing, and then I deleted it worried I&#39;d be called out as trite, but then I did it again, because, whatever, it&#39;s true.</pre>

<pre>The reason you do not want to see how the sausage is made is because you will witness that it is produced simply by wrapping sausage in sausage-casing, which raises a regress of questioning which shall haunt you forever.</pre>

<pre>I do believe there is good in everyone. Some of my sincerely favorite tweets, absolute favorites, have come from people who I generally think of as annoying lunks on this site.</pre>

<pre>@YungCoconut Thanks. I&#39;m ok, just lost stuff; just a pain in terms of money and inconvenience, but nothing too bad, apart from the lost laptop, whose contents were all backed up.</pre>

<pre>I&#39;m ok, got hit but not injured, just lost stuff, just a pain in terms of inconvenience.

At the moment, the least convenient thing is that my phone will die soon and I lost my only charger, so I&#39;ll soon be unable to contact anyone until morning.</pre>

<pre>Apart from my laptop, there wasn&#39;t even anything there that would&#39;ve been of any use to anyone else; just, like, clothes and toiletries and a bunch of special foods my mom gave me and some photos I was supposed to give to my aunt.</pre>

<pre>But I guess that&#39;s often the way, or, I dunno, I&#39;ve never been mugged before.

Anyway, I&#39;m fine but shaken but fine but shaken, and going to bed.</pre>

<pre>@collnsmith Oh, wow, thanks, but I feel too weird to take money from friends for a thing like this that probably happens to lots of people eventually, when others have it far worse off; I guess I lost a big chunk of $ from the laptop, but I have enough savings to be upset but buy a new one.</pre>

<pre>@collnsmith Also, this happens to coincide, bittersweetly, with my being about to start a new job, which softens the blow. (Which I&#39;ll make some happier tweets about, soon enough, I guess.).

But thanks; I appreciate your looking out for me.</pre>
