Text: @swissidealism I do not endorse all his lifestyle choices, but I have long since learnt to separate the art from the artist. His talent at his medium is undeniable.

Text: We need more presidents like Ronald Reagan, who always wore a jacket in the White House because he constantly felt a little chilly, due to his decaying, diseased mind. On those rare occasions he forgot the jacket, it was also due to the same chaotic decay. Truly the last great.

Text: @Baddiel @Tankie_Viciedo You're the one who said "there's an unconscious anti-Semitic effect here", dude. I'm all for reading people correctly, but I can't see a way to read this where you didn't say this. If it's incongruous with other words you tossed in, that's only the incoherence of what you said.

Text: @ADtheG @Tankie_Viciedo @Baddiel This didn't start because some guy said "The Holocaust and colonialism were exactly the same in all respects". Rather, this all started because some guy called Winston Churchill a "white supremacist mass murderer". The facts support the elements of that quoted description.

Text: Even reading the articles isn't something I'm proud of. By this time next year, I hope to return to Encarta exclusively. Then after a few years practice with that, let's say by 2025 at latest, I aim to be a proudly fuckable owner of all 32 volumes of the final Britannica (2010).

Text: It's not what you think! I just read the articles, I don't edit them! Sure, I edited a few when I was younger, we all make mistakes in our youth, but I've learnt since then. My resolve stays strong even when reading the most egregious typos.

Text: @rogerbellin That's what I do with Playboy. I use the Encyclopedia Britannica for all my reference information needs and Playboy for all my pornography needs, as a proper adult does.

Text: This dumb lady in her rush to judgment can't parse intent, but watching the full video makes the context clear: Bernie is only noting these stereotypes to undercut them in support of his main point, his unflagging support for television pioneer Bill Cosby.
