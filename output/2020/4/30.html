Text: Folks seriously think the answers for how to bring about socialism are found in the details of Marx? He didn't know how, evidenced by 150ish years of him being The Guy and it not having happened. I find him insightful but I'd still loosen the fixation on the Great Man of History.

Text: @MattWatchGundam I didn't say he's not an insightful critic. I just think it's silly when people talk about Marx and reading Marx as the alpha and the omega and the source of all truth and all answers, like Protestants to scripture.

Text: @curiouswavefn I support the socialist project. I am not against socialism. I generally support Marx, for that matter. I am just complaining that people sometimes talk as if all the answers and insights for how to bring about socialism were already discovered and lie waiting in Marx.

Text: A minor thing NJR was right about: "dialectics" is an effectively meaningless term. There's no reason for leftists to care about "the Hegelian dialectic", "the negation of the negation" etc. It's just a quirk of history that these are phrases they've been bequeathed to play with.

Text: @wokeimperialist This is crankery, albeit of an educated sort. Why should negating a mean multiplying it by -1 to get -a, but once more negating -a mean multiplying it by -a this time to yield a^2? What is the point of this mathematical invocation anyway? Just some false sheen of indisputability. https://t.co/WZMT6X54AB

Text: @wokeimperialist It's blather. It's a kind of rough poetry, perhaps, that feels the need to clothe itself as a Science of Laws.

I think Marx, Engels, et al had many great insights, but all this stuff about laws of dialectics is shot through with crankery, and it's silly to pretend otherwise.

Text: @kirstenmorry The relevant facts are that there is a thing called the Dialectica Interpretation, which is usually discussed hand-in-hand with a thing called the double-negation translation. And there's a completely different thing, dialectics, which has a "law of the negation of the negation".
