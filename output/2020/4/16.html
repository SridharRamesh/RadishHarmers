Text: Let ζ(-p) = 1^p + 2^p + 3^p + … be the Riemann zeta function. This converges when the real component of p is &lt; -1. How do we make sense of this for general powers p?

Text: Everyone talks about the Riemann zeta function like it's tricky to construct and requires thinking about the sophisticated machinery of meromorphic continuation. It's not and it doesn't. It's much simpler than that.

Text: Another notation for the same thing is that S'(x) = f'(x) + f'(x + 1) + f'(x + 2) + … may well converge for all x, even if S(x) itself doesn't.

This derivative tells us a lot! Integrating its derivative tells us everything about what S should be, except for an unknown +C term.

Text: Let's give this a nice name as a function: S(x) = f(x) + f(x + 1) + f(x + 2) + ….

And note that S(a) - S(b) should be [f(a) - f(b)] + [f(a + 1) - f(b + 1)] + [f(a + 2) - f(b + 2)] + …, which may converge even if neither S(a) nor S(b) converge in themselves.

Text: Well, let's consider a more general problem. Things are often simpler in greater abstraction, at least to my mindset. Suppose you want to make sense of f(x) + f(x + 1) + f(x + 2) + … in general, even though this may not converge. What can you do?

Text: In other words, so long as some number of differentiations makes it converge, we know what f(x) + f(x + 1) + f(x + 2) + … should be, up to a polynomial term.

But how do we figure out what the +Cs in the integrations should be taken to be?

Text: In the same way, we could take 2nd or higher derivatives. So even if the first derivative doesn't make it converge, so long as SOME higher derivative converges, we can recover f(x) + f(x + 1) + f(x + 2) + … by repeated integration, once we know which +Cs to pick at each step.

Text: One subtlety is that, in the last integration to get f(x) + f(x + 1) + f(x + 2) + …, this will require us to evaluate the -1-th derivative of f; that is, we can only carry out this technique after we've already settled on a choice of antiderivative for f itself. But that's fine.

Text: What our above reasoning implicitly shows is that our technique for defining F'(x) + F'(x + 1) + F'(x + 2) + … gives the unique pseudopolynomial function whose average value on each [b, b + 1] is -F(b) [with this existing if and only if F itself is pseudopolynomial].

Text: In this way, we can evaluate x^p + (x + 1)^p + (x + 2)^p + … for general p [this is called the Hurwitz zeta function, ζ(-p, x)] and by using the specific value x = 1, we get the Riemann zeta function.

Text: Now we need to pick an antiderivative for f. Specifically, an antiderivative which approaches 0 when f(x) + f(x + 1) + f(x + 2) + … is already convergent and that extends this in a clean pattern more generally. The natural choice is to use the antiderivative x^(p + 1)/(p + 1).

Text: For example, the question is often posed of how to generalize the factorial to non-integer arguments.

Well, the defining property of the factorial is that x! = x * (x - 1)!. In other words, log(x!) = log(x) + log((x - 1)!).

Text: Well, there's one hitch: when p = -1, our antiderivative x^(p + 1)/(p + 1) involves a division by zero. And this is why the zeta function has a pole at the power -1 (i.e., at the harmonic series).

At every other power, everything works out smoothly, to some finite number.

Text: @wokeberia And we are talking about a situation where we already know what S(x) is everywhere up to a constant, and are now trying to determine the value of that constant using the also known value of the integral of S(x) dx as x runs from b to b + 1.

Text: @wokeberia This is a completely different idea than extending the zeta function to general p by using analyticity. For one thing, I've not even mentioned the concept of being differentiable or analytic with respect to the argument p.

Text: @wokeberia You can run this argument without ever thinking about analyticity with respect to p, much less knowing about uniqueness of analytic continuation.

Text: @wokeberia Another way to see this is different from analytic continuation is that this technique also immediately gave us the gamma function as the unique "pseudopolynomial" solution to its recurrence relation, something difficult to derive as a matter of unique analytic continuation.

Text: @wokeberia That said, the result is indeed the same result you would get from analytic continuation, as it must be.

Text: @wokeberia And this can be explained by the fact that the result is complex-differentiable with respect to p, with derivative log(x) * x^p + log(x + 1) * (x + 1)^p + log(x + 2) * (x + 2)^p + …, which again can be summed for general p by the same technique.

Text: @allahliker Out of curiosity, as I've heard you say this often, on what issues do you feel your politics departs from "leftist" and aligns with "liberal" instead?
