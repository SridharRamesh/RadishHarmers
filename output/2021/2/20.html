Text: The sun rover lands and begins transmitting its report to a panel of eagerly awaiting scientists. Chemical composition, gravitational strength, Polish astronaut corpses per square kilometer, pH levels, electrical activity, and so on.

Text: @luminescentorb It's certainly also possible to get paneer masala without bell pepper, of course (I'm assuming it's bell pepper). I don't mean to say that that's not common either, just that both are common. And if you prefer pepper-less, go for it, I'm all for people liking whatever they like.

Text: @luminescentorb I'm of the philosophy that everyone has their one food that utterly disgusts them, and that's fine. (It's fine even if they have a hundred foods that disgust them, but particularly, I think it's just an empirical fact that almost everybody has their one).

Text: @luminescentorb Grow or not, who cares? People make too big a moral issue out of "picky eaters", as though they don't have their own likes and dislikes in every other facet of life. As though they watch every movie and befriend every person and eat every substance on Earth for dinner.
