<pre>You&#39;re not allowed to have a square root in the denominator. Don&#39;t write &quot;3 / (5 √2) = (3 √2) / 10&quot;. Write &quot;(3 √2) / 10 = (3 √2) / 10&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@w3ll_adjusted There&#39;s no good reason. Schools insist on this because it standardizes the form, making it easier to grade tests. That&#39;s all.</pre>

<pre>@w3ll_adjusted Alright, I&#39;m being a little uncharitable. Back in the day, doing calculations by hand, you&#39;d have tables of square roots memorized or available, and not necessarily want to bother doing the same for their reciprocals as well. But that&#39;s it, that&#39;s the only thing.</pre>

<pre>@jlindy77 @w3ll_adjusted It&#39;s extremely common to this day. When I taught college math, it was very difficult to get students to feel comfortable leaving radicals in denominators. They&#39;d had it drilled into them as such a taboo no-no, that one must always finish by &quot;rationalizing the denominator&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@w3ll_adjusted If you like, it&#39;s the same impulse that says to write 3/2 instead of 6/4. You could say standardization is motivated by that kind of thing, which sometimes counts as simplification. And it is easier to tell if things are equal or not if they have a standard form.</pre>

<pre>@w3ll_adjusted But there&#39;s nothing wrong with writing 6/4 either, and there&#39;s nothing simpler about radicals in numerator vs denominator.</pre>

<pre>@w3ll_adjusted If there&#39;s some use for which you need it, if you&#39;re at the moment where you want to compare two things for equality, then you can deal with it then (and you can just as well put both radicals in the denominator). There&#39;s no need to do it pre-emptively.</pre>

<pre>@AmanitheTender1 Yes, instead of 2 / π, you must take care to write 2π / π^2.</pre>

<pre>@shitshowdotinfo How so? A commonly shared false memory is a different thing from a memory of media no longer easy to access.</pre>

<pre>@shitshowdotinfo But the Mandela effect, in the sense of &quot;Commonly shared false memories that people are completely convinced of&quot;, existed well before the Internet.</pre>

<pre>@shitshowdotinfo If some are convinced of one memory and some are convinced of a contradictory memory, well, the fact that they may erroneously assume the Internet should present definitive evidence resolving the dispute is interesting, but it&#39;s not the source of the dispute in the first place.</pre>

<pre>@shitshowdotinfo The eponymous example is mistakenly remembering Mandela as having died. I don&#39;t see how that would be just a reflection of an &quot;If I can&#39;t find it on the Internet, it doesn&#39;t exist&quot; mindset.</pre>

<pre>@shitshowdotinfo I mean, I agree the Mandela effect is trivial, I just think the triviality is differently located. But I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m arguing about this, whatever.</pre>

<pre>@shitshowdotinfo Tangentially: I wasn&#39;t familiar with this controversy, but looking it up, I&#39;ve only found videos where people say &quot;No, that&#39;s not it!&quot;. What&#39;s the old video that was found that you&#39;re referring to?</pre>

<pre>@shitshowdotinfo Which ABC one? Every Tinkerbell clip I look up, people are commenting &quot;This isn&#39;t the Tinkerbell intro I remember!!&quot; and talking about the Mandela effect. I can&#39;t find one where people go &quot;Oh, yes, this is the one I remember! The mystery is resolved!&quot;. I want to see that one.</pre>
