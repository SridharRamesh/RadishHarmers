<pre>Folks seriously think the answers for how to bring about socialism are found in the details of Marx? He didn&#39;t know how, evidenced by 150ish years of him being The Guy and it not having happened. I find him insightful but I&#39;d still loosen the fixation on the Great Man of History.</pre>

<pre>@MattWatchGundam I didn&#39;t say he&#39;s not an insightful critic. I just think it&#39;s silly when people talk about Marx and reading Marx as the alpha and the omega and the source of all truth and all answers, like Protestants to scripture.</pre>

<pre>@curiouswavefn I support the socialist project. I am not against socialism. I generally support Marx, for that matter. I am just complaining that people sometimes talk as if all the answers and insights for how to bring about socialism were already discovered and lie waiting in Marx.</pre>

<pre>A minor thing NJR was right about: &quot;dialectics&quot; is an effectively meaningless term. There&#39;s no reason for leftists to care about &quot;the Hegelian dialectic&quot;, &quot;the negation of the negation&quot; etc. It&#39;s just a quirk of history that these are phrases they&#39;ve been bequeathed to play with.</pre>

<pre>@wokeimperialist This is crankery, albeit of an educated sort. Why should negating a mean multiplying it by -1 to get -a, but once more negating -a mean multiplying it by -a this time to yield a^2? What is the point of this mathematical invocation anyway? Just some false sheen of indisputability. https://t.co/WZMT6X54AB</pre>

I think Marx, Engels, et al had many great insights, but all this stuff about laws of dialectics is shot through with crankery, and it&#39;s silly to pretend otherwise.</pre>

And there&#39;s a completely different thing, dialectics, which has a &quot;law of the negation of the negation&quot;.</pre>
