Text: @sodburger I'm near clinching a job I'd like a lot, and I don't want anything to scuttle it. It probably doesn't matter, but I'm having these moments of paranoia (then moments of being "I'm being silly", then paranoia again…), paradoxically more so the closer I get to getting the job.

Text: @non_computable The trouble is, it's more like I worry I may be constantly, unthinkingly, condescending and rude to everyone. But, of course, for more acute instances, your suggestion is the way to go. (Oh god, I'm not being unduly dismissive right now, am I?…)

Text: @christapeterso It's, honestly, so good. I cannot contain how funny this was to me. (I know that's the stock insincere response, "This is funny to me, actually", but it is!)

I deserve it; I was sort of making fun of him and his question, implicitly, originally. Nature gave me due comeuppance.
