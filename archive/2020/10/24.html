<pre>@tinybaby Instead of talking in terms of marginal tax rates, people should just show the graph of post-tax income as a function of pre-tax income. Everything is obvious on the graph.</pre>

<pre>@htpyFiber @Category_Fury It&#39;s a historical accident but so are most elements of notation and terminology. It&#39;s a historical accident that we call the integers after the letter zee at all.</pre>

<pre>@yarbsalocin @Irish_Atheist I was willing to let it just die but I appreciate your defending me on the obvious point that saying words can mean something other than literally endorsing them. For example, Irish Atheist says here &quot;The Holocaust did not happen&quot;. https://t.co/lXIiGcaSaf</pre>

<pre>@MuddyPenguins @yarbsalocin @Irish_Atheist He doesn&#39;t come from Jewish ancestry and he doesn&#39;t believe in the Jewish religion, so, I don&#39;t know. Not that I think it matters, but maybe the high horse is a bit undeserved. He&#39;s converted to Judaism (in some racial consubstantiation ritual) only for the joke-scolding.</pre>

<pre>@MuddyPenguins @yarbsalocin @Irish_Atheist Obviously, we feel differently about jokes. You are perfectly free to not like these jokes, of course. I would not say these jokes to you as I know you would not care for them. So I did not. I said this joke to my followers who like such jokes.</pre>

<pre>@MuddyPenguins @yarbsalocin @Irish_Atheist It&#39;s a bit irritating to be threatened with violence simply for making a quote-parallelism silly logic joke on how Holocaust deniers can be dumb, but I also know the threats are meaningless, no biggie.

All the best. Have a good weekend.</pre>

<pre>Sort of a throwback, standup all went the other way. This honestly doesn&#39;t feel so different from Russell Peters type stuff that was all the rage when I was in college. Maybe I&#39;m just sympathetic because my mother also married an Indian guy. https://t.co/kqYuwVyr7K</pre>

You&#39;re always saying people only complain when it&#39;s just their ox that got gored, you hypocrite&quot;. I agree. I just can&#39;t buy the premise that Native Americans committed 9/11.</pre>
