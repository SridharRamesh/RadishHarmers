Text: The last time I did this, for the record. Nothing here is new; just the same old fads, repeated once yearly. https://t.co/i7hh8CiYK7

Text: Manhattan [in the alternate universe where everything didn't move over to Brooklyn, and also in the '80s, and also in the real universe and current day but less archetypally so; fuck, this would've been easier if Brooklyn were an island…] https://t.co/UedtSwcEr8

Text: @nerflad At the end of the day, everything's on an island at some scale, but it's just nice when the archetypal region is coterminous with the island, as the old refrain goes.

Text: First the Democrats get a President whose last name sounds like Osama and whose middle name matches Saddam Hussein. What's next, some successor whose last name looks like Bin Laden and whose first name matches Stalin, Mengele, and Goebbels?

Text: Snapchat prudishly refuses to tell me how large my tits are. No judgement; I just want to know the facts about myself. Who I can donate blood to and so on.

Text: Mother's Day is tricky, because of the stereotypical antipathy between mothers and their own mother-in-laws. It is impossible to make every mother happy; their interests are opposed, there is not solidarity.

Text: I love my mother, who has been nicer to me than anyone else in history. And for this reason, she must never see my Twitter. She must never know the shame of what she has wrought. Frankly, each new day is a challenge. Frankly, the sooner she dies, the better.

Text: @MohimenMahbuba What assholes these men are, to be attracted to a woman who maybe secretly hints of androgyny in her looks. All good men scrupulously scrutinize potential dates for any hint of dealbreaker mannish qualities before swiping or otherwise experiencing interest.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law It's Tinder, too. They're messaging you because you mutually matched. You explicitly told them you were open to, and indeed interested in, being messaged!
