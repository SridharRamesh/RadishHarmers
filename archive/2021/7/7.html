<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">They bring Bob Odenkirk, master yeller, on for a sketch in S2E2, but it is one of the few non-yelling-based sketches. Which makes it one of the best ones.</p></blockquote>

People are taken with it because they like that, and also because they like that the episodes are short. The 20% has its moments.</p></blockquote>
