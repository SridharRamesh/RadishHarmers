Text: @dlphd2 It's not some great conspiracy leaking out. Some rando put it there today while also calling him a dictator (see the specific edit: https://t.co/qWJIwvJTjM). Any rando can put anything on Wikipedia; it hardly seems worthy of surprise that sometimes they do.

Text: @itsbirdemic I hope you will be following up with second birthday, third birthday, seventh birthday, etc, just to force everyone here to truly confront and stew in the pain of the contradictory tendencies of ordinary English here. Let this be a lesson to everyone to switch to zero-indexing.

Text: RT @RadishHarmers: An apology is an impossible ritual we pretend people are extra remiss for falling short of.

There is no apology anyone…

Text: I think a person can say some dumb shit, and just be a person who said some dumb shit, without needing to be full-on junk-heaped. (And, though I know this is pushing the envelope, I even feel this way at times about not merely saying but in fact believing some dumb wrong shit.)

Text: However trite now, most clichés were once excitingly creative. There was some reason they got so popular; it's not their fault what followed.

Text: You want to talk toxic masculinity? Every morning, I wake up and take a knife to my face because I don't like the way it looks, a habit I was trained into by my father.

Text: @soft_btw As a lifelong vegetarian, I had no idea what chicken breasts were like. Thank god you saved me before I embarrassed myself in front of the boys, 40yo Virgin style, with my flailing description "Sure I've touched a chicken breast before! Yeah, uh, oh, so womanly, so titty-like…".

Text: There's nothing special about living in New York (population: 8.6 million). It is empirically the least special city in America. Now, living in Fish Springs, Nevada (population: 648)? That's special. Hardly anyone gets to experience that.

Oh, I'll give Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a cheer alright! I'll give her a real Bronx cheer…

Text: @negrosubversive Oh, you can have whatever standards you have. It's all case-by-case and subjective. But my own attitude is pretty forgiving of, say, rando nobodies who made dumb jokes five years ago. I'm happy to say they were dumb, but I don't care to lord it over them as forever irredeemable.

Text: @negrosubversive If they're dumb now, they're dumb now. If not, great. And if they're dumb now but not actually wielding power heinously, they're dumb but otherwise fine, maybe even good. Etc. I feel like these distinctions sometimes get collapsed here. People can just be a bit dumb, it's fine.

Text: @negrosubversive Hm, some people do but a lot don't. I feel like there's a lot of "That's not a real apology..." responses for every "Sorry, I said something dumb back then. I know better now and have not said and will not say such things again" admission. (I will say, maybe I'm being dumb now…)
