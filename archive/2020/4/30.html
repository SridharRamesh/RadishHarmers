<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Folks seriously think the answers for how to bring about socialism are found in the details of Marx? He didn&#39;t know how, evidenced by 150ish years of him being The Guy and it not having happened. I find him insightful but I&#39;d still loosen the fixation on the Great Man of History.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@Bodyisturd There are many things under the sun I don&#39;t understand. Most things. Some will say dialectics is one, even. But each time I ask for an example of its helpful use in action, people refuse to provide me one, instead flatly asserting its value and chiding me for not seeing it.</p></blockquote>
