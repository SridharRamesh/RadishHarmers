<pre>TED Talks really blew up about five years in, when, in a Hail Mary pass to save the franchise, they decided to allow speakers not named Ted. Founder Theodore Edward Dee resigned in protest, but still collects a portion of the royalties from each talk aired.</pre>

<pre>@guydolbey Ben Shapiro is the dumbest person alive, and he&#39;d give some corpses a run for their money too, but... in this case... yes, that&#39;s the joke. Congrats on the numbers. This is textbook https://t.co/mkZCJVrMde.</pre>

<pre>I couldn&#39;t pronounce my name until rather late in life (among other speech issues, I couldn&#39;t make the &quot;sh&quot; sound until middle school-ish; I forget exactly when, now, but there was a tongue surgery involved). And in retrospect, it&#39;s odd this wasn&#39;t a cause of more embarrassment…</pre>

<pre>I think sometimes I need to believe I&#39;m worse than everyone else because I need to believe I&#39;m special. (It helps me make sense of the narrative of my life, in which I play a special role)</pre>
