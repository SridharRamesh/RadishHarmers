<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@madsamarxist @cbarrett The functoriality here, btw, is the chain rule. Which is cool. The ultimate expression of all this coolness is synthetic differential geometry, carried out in toposes where this functor arises from actual reified infinitesimals, with ALL functions being EXACTLY linear wrt these.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I get irrationally angry when I see folks coding on the BART, even though they&#39;re just people who have jobs they&#39;re made to do, same as me. Just kids doing their homework on the school bus. (This is more acceptable on the morning commute to the boss than the evening commute away)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sridhar is an idea, a state of mind. You could no more put an end to Sridhar than to children&#39;s wonder, cool breezes on summer days, or sitting with a nice girl for two hours yet it feeling like a minute. You couldn&#39;t unfollow him if you wanted to. Believe me; the military tried.</p></blockquote>

Not even a banana. If you hand me an unwashed fruit to eat, I will slap that shit to the ground like it&#39;s arsenic.</p></blockquote>
