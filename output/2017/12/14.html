Text: @pookleblinky It's not obvious to me how to win. The guaranteed winning strategies are only known for small boards, and via exhaustive computer search (though it's beautifully simple to nonconstructively prove the first player can force a win).

Text: @haircut_hippie @BillHumphreyMA Also, if you're rich, you can just comfortably afford insurance, right? You'd have to really hate dealing with insurance, or really really be rich, for it to someone be better to forgo it, I think.

Text: @BillHumphreyMA @haircut_hippie I will call that "really, really rich" territory.

(Although I'm still not sure why you wouldn't just get insurance for some of the same reasons anyone does; hedge against the financial loss of catastrophic tragedy, even though in this case you could comfortably weather it.)

Text: TV criticism is just impossible these days. Everyone thinks good TV is about watching good people (likable people you want to be friends with) have good things happen to them, perhaps occasionally punctuated by simply bad people having bad things happen, then back to our friends.

Text: @christapeterso You're looking for TV shows like this? I'm saying most TV criticism I find is like this; praising or tut-tutting each episode of each TV show to precisely the extent it adheres to or departs from this standard. Which is uninteresting commentary to me.

Text: I'd rather have seen my grandpa and told him I love him, but everyone complained, "The machine's expensive!", "We only get 1 use…". So, fine, fine. I went back in time and killed Hitler like you wanted. You all happy now? It was easy, too; he was just hiding out in some bunker.
