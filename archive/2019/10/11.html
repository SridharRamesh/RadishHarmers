<pre>This seems really impressive, that they could keep such a large structure from toppling before it was fully built, until you realize they just filmed it backwards and are playing the footage in reverse. https://t.co/fiAJZUXsPE</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory It&#39;s not some wild coincidence that all the possibilities work out. It has to be so. For any n and r (at least 3, let&#39;s say, to ignore making sense of the more degenerate cases), one can construct a plane of appropriate curvature to put r many regular n-gons around each vertex.</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory When this curvature is positive, this plane can be identified with a sphere, and our tiling becomes a regular spherical tiling, which amounts to a Platonic solid.</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory When this curvature is zero, we get a regular tiling of the Euclidean plane. When this curvature is negative, we get a regular tiling of the hyperbolic plane.

But in any case, we get some regular tiling.</pre>

<pre>@ModelOfTheory And the inequality you note (r &amp;lt; 1/(1/2 - 1/n); i.e., 1/r + 1/n - 1/2 &amp;gt; 0) is precisely the condition that the curvature be positive.</pre>
