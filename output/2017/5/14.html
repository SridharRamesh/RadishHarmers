Text: @sqrtnegative1 STEM is big and the world is HUUUUGE. But I've also grown lazy in my old age. Non-STEM stuff is hard too, alas. I mostly watch TV and tweet.

Text: @cbarrett @liberalism_txt I think this is an instance of the continuing common phenomenon of Americans not distinguishing the terminology of "liberal" vs. "leftist".
