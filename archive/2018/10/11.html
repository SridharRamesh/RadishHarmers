<pre>@quasicoherence @PRDGM1 Yes, there are theorems of this sort. For example, any first-order statement about natural number arithmetic (equivalently, any first-order statement about hereditarily finite sets) which can be proven in ZFC (i.e., with Zorn) can be proven as well in ZF (i.e., without Zorn).</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence @PRDGM1 I don&#39;t know if &quot;first-order&quot; is a concept that&#39;s widely known outside logic or not, but what this amounts to in this context is, statements built up from Boolean connectives, computable functions/relations, and universal or existential quantifiers ranging over N or V_ ω.</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence @PRDGM1 Proof: The inner model L always satisfies ZFC even if the ambient model V only satisfies ZF, yet N or V_ω relativized to L is unchanged from the ambient model&#39;s &quot;true&quot; N or V_ω.

We can go further and note that axioms like Foundation also make no difference to statements about N.</pre>

<pre>Spotting a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album among my friend&#39;s library, I turn up my nose. How gauche! How unrefined! Luckily, I&#39;ve brought some records from my own collection. A true music buff, I put on &quot;Just the Filler&quot; followed by &quot;Widely Panned&quot;, with &quot;Dross, Utter Dross&quot; ready on deck.</pre>

<pre>@PRDGM1 @sigfpe @quasicoherence Zorn&#39;s lemma being false doesn&#39;t require all sets to be measurable, though the converse is true. Out of curiosity, though, why do you find it annoying for all sets to be measurable? It seems very natural for many to instead be annoyed by the existence of non-measurable sets!</pre>

<pre>@PRDGM1 @sigfpe @quasicoherence (At any rate, at any moment, you can work within the framework most natural and pleasing to the moment&#39;s context: using Zorn&#39;s lemma in contexts where it is natural, taking all sets to be measurable in other contexts where that is instead natural, and so on and so on.</pre>

<pre>Playing 12-dimensional chess, and finding it disappointing. The pieces still move the same way, never leaving the plane they all start on.

I mean, you can see the board from different angles, that&#39;s kinda cool. Rooks look wicked from the 7th standard side. Still, expected more…</pre>
