I used to think I would do real comedy. I dabbled in my way. It was a large part of why to move to New York. But I've not done much lately. Essentially nothing. Covid killed things first, but now that's over and I'm still not doing it. Other hassles to attend to. Maybe next year.

Not that perpendicularity is actually important to this result. All that matters is that the height is x, the height of the base is x, the height of the base's base is x, etc, on some choice of a dimension as "height" at each stage. It could perfectly well be a slanted simplex.

Free Guy doesn't look like a movie I would enjoy, but I also think it's fine if they make movies for kids about videogames and crossover references. I liked stuff like that when I was a kid too. The annoying thing isn't that kids' movies exist, but that other movies don't.

Why make them memorize any of it then? Memorizing cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2 but not cos(36°) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4. Seems silly, if there's not actually some great purpose served by this. Not that I'm against knowing things, but it seems outsized attention.

That's often what an explanation *is*.

"Because you tried to divide by zero"

This is useful because you're pointing out that what happened in this case is just an example of a more general phenomenon and the explainee can reuse that in other contexts

It’s because in high school everyone learns how to skateboard, and skateboarding tricks are often referred to by the amount of rotation the board does, almost always in 90° increments (360 flip, frontside 180 to fakie nosegrind, switch 270 to frontside board slide, and the like)

I'm not surprised by the attention paid to increments of 90°. That is genuinely a very significant angle. I'm surprised by the attention paid to 30° and 60°.

Why make them memorize any of it then? Memorizing cos(30°) = sqrt(3)/2 but not cos(36°) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4. Seems silly, if there's not actually some great purpose served by this. Not that I'm against knowing things, but it seems outsized attention.

That's often what an explanation *is*.

"Why did the program fail?"
"Because you tried to divide by zero"

This is useful because you're pointing out that what happened in this case is just an example of a more general phenomenon and the explainee can reuse that in other contexts

It’s because in high school everyone learns how to skateboard, and skateboarding tricks are often referred to by the amount of rotation the board does, almost always in 90° increments (360 flip, frontside 180 to fakie nosegrind, switch 270 to frontside board slide, and the like)

For what it's worth, you can construct a 72° angle in that fashion just as well. Nothing new, Euclid did it. I will grant that it's tedious, but everything's tedious in compass and straightedge.

It's not actually important that the witnesses here be "natural numbers"; they can be whatever kinds of things you think of as simultaneously representing computer programs and the inputs to computer programs. So, bitstrings or whatnot.

The usual convention on profunctors would have us put the covariant argument first, contravariant second. However, (->) is already fixed in place, so if I want to work with the ur-profunctor of them all for Haskell I'm stuck. This echoes confusingly through the rest of the lib.

I did manage to be able to see on the OMNY website what trips it thinks I've taken when, but there's no easy way to correlate those with these RECOVER charges which come later, no idea what charge corresponds to what, so I have no way of telling if the charges are right or wrong.

Yes, but I think people often implicitly have in mind that implication means a kind of necessary implication. "Need" is a distraction, but one might still see modality in your desired "if... then" vs. mere material implication.

But having said that, I've spent enough time with constructive proofs via Haskell and Agda that many classical propositions make me feel a bit uneasy these days.

I know the relevant thing here is whether "A -> (B v C)" entails "(A -> B) v (A -> C)", which holds classically but not intuitionistically. But like, there IS a natural interpretation of those things that justifies the classical claim.

So it's odd to me to say something untrustworthy has happened in the classical logic itself, as such. I'd rather blame an erroneous choice of how to translate into this formalism some informal thing that was meant to be interpreted differently.

"Morally abhorrent" is an overly strong way of putting it. Still, I feel like a large number of the people who like this Welles bit engage in plenty of self-deprecation or projected timidity of their own. They praise the putdown, but its argument isn't actually what resonates.

I think people are generally young enough on here that they only know Welles as the Important Film guy. As a man of some age, his rep when I was young was of a unpleasant fat guy who died of fatness while doing dog food commercials. But Woody Allen has always been an easy target

intersection of all closed sets containing A is the closure of A

the intersection of all open sets containing A is the ______ of A

What goes in the blank, is there some standard term? (I'm working with Alexandroff spaces where doing this construction always makes sense)

Outside the context of Alexandrov spaces, it's less useful a notion, because an intersection of opens is no longer necessarily any such nice set like another open.

Basically, you might as well just use order-theoretic rather than topological terminology for things about Alexandrov spaces (especially things that don't generalize within topology), as they're just the same as preorders and so much order-theoretic terminology already exists.

Page count isn't the relevant metric, it's far from the actual measure of completion, but it's the easiest metric to see. 

Eight pages in ten weeks. Pathetic. But eight beats eight lower numbers. If I had started doing this at the start of the pandemic, I'd be done by now.

Categories internal to Cat are just as unstrict as ordinary categories, when Cat is taken as a 2/bi-category rather than a 1-category and we use an appropriate notion of internal categories accordingly. Your strictness concern would apply to categories internal to 1-categories.

Most internal categories aren't particularly itching to become 2/bi-categorical. For example, what is a category internal to FinSet? It is a finite category. But a finite category doesn't come with any interesting 2-cell structure. Yet still it's a fine notion often of interest.

Oh, but I see now you were talking about double categories here instead of internal categories. Yeah, probably many double categories are itching to become bicategorical. Though I also think double categories have their uses.

Another reference to his youthful illness in the last snippet here. Probably unrelated to this cancer decades later, but who knows? It's clear he didn't want these to be part of his public image, very understandably, but I can't help but have my curiosity.

Norm MacDonald played down his intelligence, believing a dumb guy persona was best for comedy. In reality, Norm completed high school at the age of 14 and was accepted into Carleton University when he was 16.

I wonder how many people watched the Norm MacDonald/Courtney Thorne-Smith interview on Conan prior to YouTube. There wasn't much of a market for reruns of nightly talk shows back then. A jewel that could easily have been lost to obscurity.

Norm Macdonald is amazing, because the stuff everyone remembers him for are the hackiest topics of the 90s (OJ, …) and some inane repeated catchphrases ("You guessed it... Frank Stallone!"), and yet somehow, despite all that, he is also the funniest human there is; the greatest.

Everyone's fixating on the swollen testicles aspect of this made-up story, but I still find this the most striking. Being weeks from getting married and having such little investment in the relationship as to bail at some slight medical issue that popped up for, at most, "weeks".

Properties like a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c do not hold in IEEE 754. Properties like a < a + 1 do not hold.

There are relatively few clean simple universal algebraic laws available for most operations on most arithmetic formats most programmers are given by default.

A paucity of such properties is a paucity of tools with which to reason about one's code. It is a chore to write, refactor, and maintain code when one is to keep a huge system of complex gotchas most are never even taught in one's head rather than clean simple rules.

While I was in college at a state school I worked as a tutor for 4 years. In  the population of mostly business majors at a state school, ~1/4 need to use a phone or paper to know 7x8. I don’t expect the 25% to be lower in the overall pop. Maybe not 50%, probably close though

Using paper to get the answer is still knowing what 7x8 amounts to, just not having it memorized. And a person might use a phone to calculate it for convenience, while being able to figure it out manually if they should be forced to.

A term corresponding to the product of numerators here (du with w constant, dv with u constant, dw with v constant) plus a term corresponding to the product of denominators here (dv with w constant, etc). Since their sum is zero (our vanishing determinant), their ratio is -1.

I mean at the software level. The hardware can do whatever. But there's nothing nuts about hardware that supports non-fixed-width computation. The hardware already does support it. It's just not the sort of thing thought of as primitive. But that's the point of software.

A computing machine is perfectly well capable of manipulating non-fixed-width types. Strings are a canonical example. Humans don't constrain themselves to fixed width types in calculations.

No one talking about Turing machines or any other such thing bothered about fixed width. It's not a necessity, it's just a design choice.

I admit I haven't dug into the nittiest and grittiest details of how IEEE floats work. They're not terribly intuitive, but I didn't exactly see anything I thought should have been done differently, or a more appropriate way of doing things
Sridhar Ramesh
@RadishHarmers

Sep 13
"They're not terribly intuitive" is the whole problem. People write code expecting laws that aren't the case. Associativity of addition, say. Without simple clean laws holding that people expect to reason with, it is unduly difficult to write, refactor, and maintain correct code.

I remember my teachers telling my mom that they were concerned that I wasn't memorizing my multiplication tables and she told em doesn't everyone eventually do it anyways?

Now I don't know if that makes me dumber than avg, but I can multiply today.

There's no need to memorize multiplication tables anyway. You can always just reconstruct them if you need them. If speed is of the essence, use a calculator.

Yes. This should be the default integral type, from the programmer's point of view. Other types with less intuitive behavior should only come into play by special request.

In software sure, but I assume he meant at the hardware level. The implications for chip design seem nuts.

I mean at the software level. The hardware can do whatever. But there's nothing nuts about hardware that supports non-fixed-width computation. The hardware already does support it. It's just not the sort of thing thought of as primitive. But that's the point of software.

A computing machine is perfectly well capable of manipulating non-fixed-width types. Strings are a canonical example. Humans don't constrain themselves to fixed width types in calculations.

No one talking about Turing machines or any other such thing bothered about fixed width. It's not a necessity, it's just a design choice.

I admit I haven't dug into the nittiest and grittiest details of how IEEE floats work. They're not terribly intuitive, but I didn't exactly see anything I thought should have been done differently, or a more appropriate way of doing things
Sridhar Ramesh
@RadishHarmers

Sep 13
"They're not terribly intuitive" is the whole problem. People write code expecting laws that aren't the case. Associativity of addition, say. Without simple clean laws holding that people expect to reason with, it is unduly difficult to write, refactor, and maintain correct code.

in wario land there is a game where you have a 50/50 shot of either doubling your money or halving it. I think you should always play because, say you have 8 coins, you either get 16 coins or 4 coins. And so in the long run you turn 8 coins to (16+4)/2 = 10 coins by playing

You're getting it wrong now by so glibly applying "expected value". It's not such a win if we analyze the logarithm of your money instead. Indeed, if you always play, after many games, you will have a near 100% probability of having nearly the same money as you started with.

Functional programming people, I've noticed, are also less likely to use meaningful variable names, alas. (I'm a functional programming guy too, but Haskell people seem particularly bad about wanting to keep variable names short, in my experience.)

Or a dumb cultural thing people think you need to use when you use common mathematical notation. But you could use meaningful variable names with sigma and pi syntax, certainly.

Functional programming people, I've noticed, are also less likely to use meaningful variable names, alas. (I'm a functional programming guy too, but Haskell people seem particularly bad about wanting to keep variable names short, in my experience.)

Or a dumb cultural thing people think you need to use when you use common mathematical notation. But you could use meaningful variable names with sigma and pi syntax, certainly.

I agree with that 1000%. That's not intrinsic to math notation or code notation. That's just a dumb cultural thing among mathematicians.

Pseudocode is made-up symbols too. People aren't born knowing what a "for loop" is; that's from Algol in 1958. Nor "++", etc. The C syntax here was popularized in 1972 (invented around 1969 for obscure language B). The math symbols were around for centuries before that.

I hate the symbols in math so much. It just feels like unnecessary gatekeeping for trivial concepts. How many mathematical proofs could be made widely accessible with just a little bit of psuedocode?

What is an example where you feel this is underused? I agree most people who write math are bad at making it uncluttered, clear, carved at the joints. In this particular case, I don't think that's been illustrated.

I'm not against programming, of course. I think of many things in such terms. In this particular case, the imperative for loop has added unnecessary details, like a specific computation order (left-associated evaluation, so to speak). That is a bothersome lack of abstraction.

More regular in what way? The distinction here also has nothing to do with subscripts or superscripts. One bother with the for loop syntax here is that for loops in general are construed as allowing side effects, mutation, etc, which is rather more to worry about, not less.

λ Σ ∏ ∫ can all be used to introduce a new symbol and are then followed by an expression containing that symbol. For many purposes λ is the universal one from which the others can be defined. Is there a name for this type of notation?

I think just for fun because Tina Fey is nostalgic for her SNL roots. (Indeed, they did two live episodes but now you can't stream one of them because everything that mentioned blackface got pulled during last year's anti-police brutality protests.)

Sure, depending on what context you are working in, you can imagine an infinitely large number evenly divisible by each finite number, sure. It's a fine concept. You're unlikely to consider any nonzero whole value divisible both by itself minus one and by itself plus one, though.

Similarly, the next degree up, we would get what would be a 3D matrix. But you aren't inclined to think 3D matrices represent a linear function. You will readily recognize, I think, that a 3D matrix corresponds to the third tensor power, and thus to cubic forms.

A degree 2 term is a quadratic form, which corresponds to a symmetric bilinear form, and this in turn corresponds to a symmetric matrix.

This matrix shouldn't be thought of as a linear transform (a (1,1) tensor). It should be thought of as a (2, 0) tensor.

Lots of insights in math are just a few paragraphs. Most insights are like this. Each book, after all, is just a series of paragraphs. Your favorite theorem may have such a short proof, building on other theorems. But whether a reviewer would let it be a paper is up to them.

Lots of insights in math are just a few paragraphs. Most insights are like this. Each book, after all, is just a series of paragraphs. Your favorite theorem may have such a short proof, building on other theorems. But whether a reviewer would let it be a paper is up to them.

But I want to stress that this plays no role in establishing the infinitude of the primes! It's just a side observation one can make.

But yes, any Boolean algebra gives rise to a topological space in a similar way, by freely adding infinite disjunctions. Thus, Stone spaces.

This is essentially Euler's proof of the infinitude of the primes, though it is often presented in terms of the zeta function.

We can take more care to analyze the exact frequency of values indivisible to all of p1, ..., pN, with whatever remainders. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this frequency will be the product of (1 - 1/p) over all these finitely many primes, which will be a nonzero product.

Therefore, this property is true of many values that have prime factors (specifically, ±1 + any nonzero multiple of p1 * ... * pN will have some prime factor not among p1, ..., pN). This is exactly Euclid's argument. Furstenberg's argument is exactly Euclid's argument.

Paying closer attention, what we've shown is that, for any finite set of primes p1, ..., pN, the property of being indivisible by all of them is periodic (with period their product). This property is also not always false (because ±1 satisfy this property).

Divisibility by any particular prime is of course periodic. So if there were finitely many primes, the property of being indivisible by all primes would be periodic. But this property is the same as being ±1, which is not periodic. Hence, there are not only finitely many primes.

Given any finitely many periodic functions, any function of their results is itself periodic, as this result's period can be taken to be any common multiple of the inputs' periods. So finite Boolean combinations (AND, OR, NOT) of periodic properties are themselves periodic.

Why are logic and topology so deeply related?  

Perhaps because we visualize a "field of possibilities" as a kind of space.  Not just a set, but a space with a topology, since some possibilities are closer to each other than others.

The whole thing is driving me mad because of the forced timing of now being my one shot at moving, but having waited till late to start looking. Last time I was more leisurely about the timing and yet it all came together fast and easy.

Started watching "The Night Of" and was impressed with the way it started with a presentation of Stokes' theorem.

(But then we realized it was a remake of a British show we didn't feel like watching again so didn't see the rest.)

Good decision. It goes off the rails by the end. Incidentally, the best or most accurate math lecture scene I've ever seen on TV was on linear algebra in the first season of The Marvelous Ms. Maisel, a show I otherwise hated. It included an apropos pun on "vector space".

Wondering who wrote the math lecture scene near the beginning of the second episode of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. A minor thing, but surprisingly well done, relative to how these things usually go; correctly explained math well-integrated with the plot point it was used to make.

My fundamental feeling on everything is this: You shouldn't have to make good decisions to get a good life. My sincere position. It's horrible to have to omnisciently make optimal decisions or else suffer. So it's funny, yes, but also upsetting when anti-vaxxers die of covid.

If I screw up, it's because, to be fair, the paper doesn't explicitly discuss inward heelflips by name. It discusses the general idea of combining flip tricks, and it gives as an example combining the frontside shove-it and heelflip to get a varial heelflip.

Thus, in SO(3), whose universal cover is a double cover, there are two paths up to homotopy between any particular orientations. And the same for SO(n) for any n ≥ 3, as the universal cover of such SO(n) is its double cover given by the spin group.

You probably had in mind that at N = 2, we have that ALL R^2s are 1, a further level of degeneracy (and at N = 1, all variance is zero, making correlations ill-defined).

At N = 3, not all R^2s are 1, but the particular R^2 we are interested in must be when A^2 and B^2 differ.

4. Raising the base of an exponential function to a power simply means rescaling this rate of change by that power. 

(And we can rescale by a wacky non-whole-number factor just as easily as by any other factor, as rescaling is just multiplication, and

3. A smooth function's behavior on small inputs amounts to its rate of change at zero. (For an exponential function, we call this rate of change the natural logarithm of its base.)

The direct story is the one in the OP, which has four parts:

1. An exponential function is one which turns sums into products.

2. An exponential function is determined by its values on small inputs (as large inputs are sums of small inputs).

Thus we get this power series extraction. But this business with how the factorial denominators arise really has nothing to do directly with understanding what exponentiation means with weird exponents. It's just another story down the line that happens to build off that.

B^x = (1 + (B^(1/N) - 1) * x)^N in the limit as N goes to ∞.

This is because differentiability means the ratio (B^s - 1) / (B^r - 1) is the same as the ratio s / r when s and r are small, so that (B^(1/N) - 1) * x is the same as B^(x/N) - 1 when N is large.

You can get e^x = (1 + x/N)^N out of B^x = (1 + (B^(1/N) - 1) * x)^N if you take e^(1/N) - 1 to be 1/N for large N, yes.

e is defined as the value for which log(e) is 1, which is to say, the value for which the derivative of e^x at x = 0 is 1, which is to say, the value for which e^(1/N) - 1 is 1/N for large N.

So each (N choose k) * log(B)^k/N^k * x^k approaches log(B)^k * x^k / k! as N grows large.

Making our series into 1 + log(B)x + log(B)^2 * x^2 / 2! + log(B)^3 * x^3 / 3! + …, which is the familiar Taylor series for e^(log(B) * x) = B^x.

Each of the binomial coefficients (N choose k) here is a degree k polynomial of N, whose leading coefficient is 1/k!.

For example, (N choose 3) is N * (N - 1) * (N - 2) / 3!.

Therefore, each (N choose k)/N^k approaches 1/k! as N grows large.

What does it mean for log(B) to be the derivative of B^x at x = 0? It means that B^ε is about the same as B^0 + log(B)ε = 1 + log(B)ε for small ε.

Put another way, B^(1/N) is about the same as 1 + log(B)/N for large N.

This means that our expression (1 + (B^(1/N) - 1) * x)^N for B^x is about the same as (1 + log(B)/N * x)^N.

If you expand this out using the binomial theorem, you get 1 + (N choose 1) * log(B)/N * x + (N choose 2) * log(B)^2/N^2 * x^2 + (N choose 3) * log(B)^3/N^3 * x^3 + …

We want LeVar Burton to host Jeopardy for the same reason we venerate Bob Ross and Mr. Rogers, and the same reason the show Ted Lasso is so popular. Our culture yearns for, and desperately needs, men who are kind and gentle, and who will teach that by example.

Kind and gentle is a fine way to be a human being, but why do people feel there is some great paucity of it on TV? Yeah, LeVar Burton and Mr. Rogers made nice shows to teach young children. Pablum works fine as children's nutrition. To serve it at a dinner party is rather bland.

Note that the K-multiset to K-tuple correspondence isn't bijective as restricted to whole values. E.g., it associates the multiset {a, b} with the tuple <a + b, ab>, which on integers must satisfy a parity constraint (if a + b is even, then ab is either odd or divisible by 4).

And it's true we can represent a multiset of cardinality K using K many symmetric polynomial functions of its elements, by considering the coefficients of the polynomial whose roots are given by the multiset. This gives a representation of K-multisets as K-tuples.

Thinking faceStates that ended the new temporary federal unemployment bonus early had 34% faster job creation in June & nearly 5% faster in July than states that continued it.

The July unemployment rate was 1.3pp lower in states that ended the bonus.

So, ending the bonus is significant.

"Ozymandias" is great and all but I don't think you can dunk on a guy for hubris if you're composing poems about his statue 3,000 years later.

I like it when apparent "coincidences" are related.   I just learned that the near-integer exp(π√163) is connected to a strange fact discovered by Euler:

 n² + n + 41 

is prime for n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 40.

The secret connection relies on this fact: (163+1)/4 = 41.

Everyone wants fewer hungry kids. But if we get rid of the work-or-starve incentive, parents of hungry children might not slave away desperately doing whatever an employer asks. They might enjoy some leisure time with their kids, as though they were a rich person.

I’ve never been asked to multiply by 0. If I multiply by 1, then the number stays the same, if I multiply by 0, does it become zero? Can you multiply by nothing?

Your schoolteachers taught you some rules, "order of operations" or PEMDAS or BIMDAS or whatever they called it, that made it sound like mathematicians really agree on one and only one way to interpret every such expression, unambiguously.

Your schoolteachers lied to you.

All of this is only notational convention and has nothing to do with actual mathematical content. And the only reason it's needed is because we've picked stupid notation that doesn't make it clear where things began and end. We could've picked better notation but didn't. The end.

soy culture isn't real. it's an internet meme. soy culture isn't why you're not getting laid because soy culture, again, is contrived. talking about soy culture (a fake thing) as if it's a serious problem (which it isn't because it's not real) is why you're not getting laid.

It's natural to find that most people you swipe through are shockingly basic. That is the nature of statistics and basicness. In other eras, most people were unappealingly basic in other ways, but you weren't swiping through hundreds of them a night to be confronted by it.

That said, I sympathize with having no idea how to market oneself from a dating perspective. I get that aspect of it, the "Dating's hard!" aspect, the marketing campaign profile-crafting fretting, all that shit. And I guess that's really what this discourse is about, in the end.

Discourse about "How to be masculine now??" is often odd. I have never felt any particular problem or need to figure out how to be masculine. What's to fret over? It is like having to figure out how to have black hair. It simply is, and if it wasn't, that would be fine too. https://twitter.com/collnsmith/status/1427849461729013764

Looking at some of their past posts, I think they're coming from a position of generally not wanting sex scenes in movies and TV, along with not wanting people to have non-procreative or non-marital sex.

All cops are bastards. Yes, even your uncle. Yes, I know you love him. Yes, I know he's unfailingly sweet to you. Yes, I know he isn't a cop, nor in a profession of any similarity to policing. No exceptions. Fuck your uncle.

Maybe framing it as "It should have been log(|...|)" isn't the best way to put it either, but the point is that those log terms should have cancelled out except for mistaken differences in branch cut choices.

The log(...) vs log(|...|) mistake is probably from an integration of 1/... somewhere. These log terms should just have died off even within the separate half-line integrals, but because of the branch cut choices were left in.

I think what's happening here is two-fold, with the two parts acting oppositely:

The sqrt(a^2) terms are being turned into |a| but should be a in one expression and -a in another, I believe.

On the other hand, the log(...) terms should actually be log(|...|) terms, I believe.

No one is saying the logarithm of a negative value would be a positive rational number. It can be taken to be an imaginary number. The base of the log here is e, incidentally. Famously, e^(i π) = -1. This is a way of talking about the dynamics of rotation. See Euler's theorem.

You can do that, resulting in a multiple of the square root of negative one, but it's not the correct answer for this integral.

Nice. Another way, if you're interested: let f(a) = (1/2)integral from -∞ to ∞ of (exp(-x^2+2ax)-exp(-x^2-2ax))/x. f'(a) is a simple Gaussian integral which comes to 2sqrt(pi)exp(a^2). Our target is f(1)/e which is integral from 0 to 1 of 2sqrt(pi)/e.exp(t^2)dt, as you said.

Consigning Afghanistan to "its" fate and not "our" business is actually disgracefully racist, not magnificently anti-imperialist. Boils down to "let the brown bastards be ground down by other brown bastards, why should we care, that's what they're like.". Not pretty put that way?

The US presence was tiny, affordable, and low-risk. Few US soldiers were in harm's way. There was no significant antiwar movement at home. The $$ is way lower than the 2010 peak.

Nice. Another way, if you're interested: let f(a) = (1/2)integral from -∞ to ∞ of (exp(-x^2+2ax)-exp(-x^2-2ax))/x. f'(a) is a simple Gaussian integral which comes to 2sqrt(pi)exp(a^2). Our target is f(1)/e which is integral from 0 to 1 of 2sqrt(pi)/e.exp(t^2)dt, as you said.

Every argument like this is imbecilic. Your brain does not function; it does not take in information and process it as evidence. It's been 20 years. What do you think we are going to accomplish now, given that we have not been able to accomplish it in 20 years of trying?

We wanted to choose the constant of integration such that this decays to zero at infinity, and a bit of investigation into the nature of R shows that setting C to zero will accomplish this.

Symmetrically, the integral of e^(-it) e^(-t^2/4) is -2/i e^(-1) R(1 - it/2) + C, and so overall, the integral of G(t) i is 2 sqrt(π) e^(-1) [R(1 + it/2) - R(1 - it/2)] + C.

Alright, let us integrate e^(it) e^(-t^2/4) = e^((1 + it/2)^2 - 1). If we use R(t) to stand for the odd antiderivative of the even function e^(t^2) [the one chosen such that R(0) = 0], then this result is clearly 2/i e^(-1) R(1 + it/2) + C.

Furthermore, the Fourier transform of f(x - 1) is e^(it) F(t), and the Fourier transform of f(x + 1) is symmetrically e^(-it) F(t). Combining these, we get that the Fourier transform of g(x) is G(t) = (e^(it) - e^(-it)) F(t) = sqrt(π) (e^(it) - e^(-it)) e^(-t^2/4).

The Fourier transform of g(x)/x, then, will be an integral of G(t) i, which is to say, an integral of i sqrt(π) (e^(it) - e^(-it)) e^(-t^2/4).

Which integral? Well, our g(x)/x has been chosen to be continuous even at 0, so its Fourier transform has to decay to zero at infinity.

For what it's worth, I believe the answer should be π/e * erfi(1) [i.e., 2 sqrt(π)/e * the integral from 0 to 1 of e^(t^2) dt], but the erfi(1) is becoming -i for some reason. I get a similar issue with Wolfram Alpha by taking the Laplace Transform of t^(-1/2) * e^(-t)/(1 - t).

The new convention "Nothing matters, bail on me with no notice whenever, it would be entitled of me to expect any different. I'm a cool girl." is absurd. But I'm not complaining. I'm a cool girl.

Recent events have made me realise that Nathan J Robinson has thicker skin than any of the "post-left" or any of the radlibs doing shit on YouTube. He has the affect of a dork, leans into it, and never melts down when people call him a plantation owning dandy with a fake accent.

Nobody knows how to define success or what they actually want and get trapped by the infantilizing structure of schooling, where the points don’t matter but at least they know how to get them. This is a problem outside of annoying website guys, as well. I’m sure you already agree

Modern computers qua the phone in my pocket. But also the mode of operation of software in general, on my home computer, is influenced by the mode of operation of the phone in my pocket. A dumb terminal to various isolated black boxes with little support for power users.

These are all queries I wish it was easy to do. That's the dream of computing. But I'm not hung up on doing it through natural language, per se. I'm happy having whatever protocol for saying such things. I just want this kind of functionality ubiquitously exposed more than it is.

I crave compositionality, but I'm very skeptical of computer systems that aspire to do things through natural language. A bunch of fragile voodoo and I can never be sure I'm saying things in just the right way they'll recognize to do what I want, when any little thing changes.

2 AM being 2 in the morning is an absurd way to speak. That's nighttime, shortly after midnight. That's the one where it's dark out. That's night.

Does 2 in the morning mean 2 AM or 2 PM? I find their contrasting example hard to make sense of.

Yeah, working till 2 AM is monstrous even if you wake up at 10 AM. Is that the life she's deliberately choosing to live, to be productive even as the world calls her lazy? What time has she left herself to actually live? What are you doing? Don't do that to yourself.

Their eggs can survive decades in dry soil. And then one summer of deep, saturating rain, and boom. LIFE!

I think it’s pretty clear it wasn’t just “cis” men who got wiped out.

It's funny how people repeatedly say on here that veganism is immoral because Native Americans traditionally aren't vegan. Oh, of course. The Chosen Race. What a fool I would have been had I merely said that people in general traditionally aren't vegan.

Prosecutors in Missouri literally argue that innocence simply doesn’t matter. The state Supreme Court agreed with them! They are ok with a innocent man rotting away in prison. This is America.
Why are wrongly-convicted people still imprisoned in Missouri?
Prosecutors have called for the release of Kevin Strickland and Lamar Johnson, who have served a combined 70 years in prison for murders they did not commit. And yet, innocence has not earned them...

I see people mocking this post as silly Twitter nonsense, and yes, it's cliche, people say such things all the time on Twitter. But it's nothing so new. The exact framing shifts slightly, but there's a long tradition of defending the "lazy" within Marxist thought. And rightly so.

The more I think about it, the more I realize that being 'lazy' is not a real thing. People are chronically ill, disabled, mentally ill, overworked, exhausted, but 'lazy' isn't even really a thing. It's just another attempt to shame people into capitalist productivity.

That's a specific relationship, not a general obligation. But if someone lives alone and chooses to own twice as many dishes washed half as often or whatever, or two roommates together agree to such laziness, that's fine, that's their prerogative.

It's essentially impossible to prove or disprove anything about mask effectiveness by looking at the correlation between spread and mask-wearing. Same deal for lockdowns. All the support for masks having some effect (and there is plenty) is indirect or theoretical.

Directly correlating case rates over a 20 day span to the overall effectiveness of masks is definitely not how that works. You are interpreting this data wrong. Even the "98% ineffective" came from literally nowhere.

Directly correlating case rates over a 20 day span to the overall effectiveness of masks is definitely not how that works. You are interpreting this data wrong. Even the "98% ineffective" came from literally nowhere.

I'm a busy man at an important job, a pillar of the business community. If I am distracted from negotiations, millions of dollars are lost. That is why I listen to music at high speed, to get it over with faster. That is why I listen exclusively to the Chipmunks covers of songs.

Dev Patel was just some guy, until he figured out what to do with his facial hair. Am I crazy? Am I the only one who remembers this? No one gave two shits about him before the facial hair. We used to spit on him as he walked. That is heartening. That will be me as well.

In that sense, given that one generally cares directly about abstraction/quantification/etc or things expressed in terms of such, focusing on combinatory logic is misguided in comparison to thinking about lambda calculus/cartesian closed categories.

Each night I review myself qua human being, assigning presentation and technical scores out of six points each. I stare at my numbers like a dieter at their scale. My therapist insists this is unhealthy. She insists a unified ten point system would be more accurate and robust.

Tennis superstars are such rank incompetents. They mess up their serves. They even double fault, at times. Every single serve should be an ace. Were there a way to win on the very first move, no grandmaster would instead move their rook diagonally. Certainly not twice in a row.

Why is everything always accounted for in some complex such scheme? Just pay everyone to live once they're old. Who cares about their youthful salary? There should be a finish line where once you get to it, you get to enjoy life. What the hell is the point of life otherwise?

"A government-run savings plan where each worker and his employer contribute 5.0% each of his/her salary which then earns interest based on government rates" is just... Social Security.  Like literally exactly that, except it's 6.2% instead of 5.0%.

I consider ADHD fake but I also think I have it. I consider it fake because I didn't have it till my thirties and nothing is real unless I had it in my youth. I think I have it now because I got a smartphone and started using social media and I never focus or accomplish anything.

Ignore the caption. These are all great spots. It's funny that they innovate by doing exactly what purist Indians complain about (mixing certain regional or national cuisines). If you wouldn't try an avocado tequila golgappa or a gruyere dosa w an edamame arbi mash, your loss. twitter.com/business/statu…

Current grids (pardon the pun) can't store power and have no way to run off excess, so they have to carefully manage supply to match demand. In cases where the generation is inflexible, they have to incentivize somebody to take it. It's not at all a fault of renewables.

Yes, that's my question. I understand producers can't store the unwanted energy, but I don't understand why they pay someone to take it. What's the person they pay going to do with it that they can't do themselves? Wouldn't it be more profitable to just use or dump it themselves?

I'm a great big curmudgeon, so I have grumbles about the way this article and people in general talk about forcing, the continuum hypothesis, mathematical Platonism, etc. But I will save those grumbles for another time. I see now the joke you were making.

People love to make up numbers to attach to things and then say they are indisputable scientific realities, because there are numbers. I hate everything that wears the costume of math as disguise.

Not just notes but timbre match in this case, it's wild. Go play them up against each other right now with a modicum of cross-fading and see for yourself. It is as though the one song simply extends its last tone unbroken for a full minute into the other's intro.

Every time Neil deGrasse Tyson makes some pedantic science quibble about a movie, everyone says "What a disgrace to Carl Sagan's legacy, Carl Sagan would never stoop to this, let's return to when pop science icons didn't pedantically quibble about movies".

He objects to Star Wars having its ships engage in faster-than-light travel. He notes this is incompatible with standard relativistic physics. He suggests hiring a physics grad student to prevent such errors. Nothing to do with any justice issue. Just pedantic science quibbles.

One might say our society has lost the knowledge that it is currently 1905. But to put it this way is silly. To take this as a revealing example of the non-monotonicity of knowledge acquisition is to be silly.

Formal modal logic is my wheelhouse, but a thing to understand about this is that Hamkins is a mathematician who happens to have ended up in a philosophy department. It is annoying how much academic philosophy has been driven by math envy to overformalization or overtechnicality.

But no one knows a way to solve Sudokus in general (generalized naturally to arbitrary size) that's much faster in the worst-case than checking every possible way to fill the grid. Which is an exponentially larger number of possibilities than just the number of cells in the grid!

The time it takes to solve one of these problems [this very particular pattern of problem all three of Hamkins' questions repeat], is about proportional to the number of cells in the grid (times the total length of all the "X knows Y knows…" chains that come up).

These puzzles are not so directly the same as Sudoku, which also involves looking across rows and columns in a different way (as well as also looking at certain 3 x 3 squares), to assert some global "Every number shows up once and only once" condition, but there is a similarity.

In a field over a Boolean algebra, any partially defined element can be seen as a restriction of a totally defined element (defined over True in the Boolean algebra), just by gluing s together with an arbitrary value defined in NOT |s| (such as 0 or 1 or -1 or 1 + 1 or whatever).

For any s and t in S, we get a unique "gluing together" (via the full sheaf condition) of all r in S such that r is simultaneously a restriction of s and of t. It soon follows that the domain of definition of this glued together value is indeed a largest p in P entailing s = t.

This is called the "sheaf" condition. Presheaves satisfying this condition are called "sheaves".

Then, whenever we have finitely many pairwise compatible s1, s2, …, sN, there should be a unique value s such that |s| = |s1| v |s2| v … v |sN| and each of s1, s2, …, sN arises as its restriction s↾p for suitable p.

That is, let us say s and t in S are compatible if, for any p such that both p ≤ |s| and p ≤ |t|, we have that s↾p = t↾p. (It suffices to consider only p given by the meet of |s| and |t|, when we have such meets).

So we should say a set strictly over P is a presheaf over P that furthermore satisfies the "representability" condition that, for any s and t, there is a largest p such that p entails s = t (we may refer to this p as |s = t|).

This is called the "sheaf" condition. Presheaves satisfying this condition are called "sheaves".

[Indeed, presheaves are called "presheaves" because historically, people cared about sheaves, and only thought of presheaves as a means to an end of getting to sheaves.]

Then, whenever we have finitely many pairwise compatible s1, s2, …, sN, there should be a unique value s such that |s| = |s1| v |s2| v … v |sN| and each of s1, s2, …, sN arises as its restriction s↾p for suitable p.

That is, let us say s and t in S are compatible if, for any p such that both p ≤ |s| and p ≤ |t|, we have that s↾p = t↾p. (It suffices to consider only p given by the meet of |s| and |t|, when we have such meets).

Given a bunch of partially defined values which are all pairwise compatible, in the sense of being equal where they are simultaneously defined, we should be able to combine them together into a value whose domain of definition is the union of their separate domains of definition.

Great, that's the first complication, the "representability" condition. We don't care about arbitrary presheaves over P, we only care about those presheaves which are strictly over P, in the above sense.

Our equations are valued not actually in P, but in a larger poset extending P (the poset of downwards closed subsets of P). In some sense, we should have been saying all along that these aren't sets over P, but are really sets over this extension over P.

If p in P is such that p ≤ |s|, p ≤ |t|, and s↾p = t↾p, then we may say "p entails s = t". But in general, there will be a whole set of various p which entail s = t, and there may be no largest such p.

First of all, in our general presheaves, for each value s in S, there is an associated truth value |s| in P for how much it "exists". But for two values s and t in S, there's not generally a particular truth value in P which corresponds to "s = t".

Think of P as a collection of truth values, with p ≤ q meaning that p entails q. The values in S are elements that may only partially exist or be defined, with |s| being the extent to which s exists. And s↾p is the partially defined value specified by "s, just in case p holds".

For every two people, there should be one and only one group DM that contains both of them. And for every two group DMs, there should be one and only one person who is in both of them.

Mathematicians will recognize this as the structure of a finite projective plane. Every known way to do this involves a number of people that's of the form P^(2n) + P^n + 1 where P is prime, but no one has ever been able to prove that it's impossible in all other cases.

In commutative rings, we can take consistency to mean not entailing 0 = 1, and we can represent equations by the difference between the two sides (which is being set to zero).

For general algebraic structures, I would take the tokens to be equations between elements of the structure, and an entailment from A, B, C, … to X means that X follows from A, B, C, … . We can consider two tokens equal if they both entail each other, if that's important.

Mount Rushmore was known to the Lakota Sioux as "The Six Grandfathers" (Tȟuŋkášila Šákpe), commemorating the six grandfathers of the Lakota nation: Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln.

They bring Bob Odenkirk, master yeller, on for a sketch in S2E2, but it is one of the few non-yelling-based sketches. Which makes it one of the best ones.

Of course, all sketch is misses and some hits, the greatest sketch shows also have their subjective misses to any viewer, so I oughtn't be too negative. I never understood the level of seemingly universal adoration ITYSL got, not my cuppa, but at least its ambitions are correct.

Conjoined twins annoyed at doctors always pushing separation regardless of the issue. Conjoinphobia is rampant in the medical community. Ultimately, they feel most comfortable seeing a conjoined twin doctor. With each diagnosis, they make sure to ask for a second opinion.

So H(1) is -1/4, and Z(1) is (-1/4)/3 = -1/12, using this generalized notion of how to make sense of Z even where it doesn't converge.

For example, Z(1) = H(1)/(2^(1 + 1) - 1) = H(1)/3.

And what's H(1)? H(1) is the limit of L(1, b) = 1b + 2b^2 + 3b^3 + 4b^4 + … as b approaches -1. But this is the Taylor series for b/(1 - b)^2. So its limit as b approaches -1 is -1/(1 + 1)^2 = -1/4.

Which means we can solve for Z(x) as H(x)/(2^(1 + x) - 1).

Since we already know how to make sense of H(x) [as the limit of the convergent series L(x, b) as b approaches -1], this tells us how to make sense of Z(x), for ANY x.

Note that when we add Z(x) to H(x), all the odd numbered terms die off, while the even numbered terms double up nicely.

We get that Z(x) + H(x) = 2 * 2^x + 2 * 4^x + 2 * 6^x + … = 2^(1 + x) * (1^x + 2^x + 3^x + …) = 2^(1 + x) * Z(x).

One nice way to make sense of Z(x) even where we don't have convergence is like this:

Consider the more general function L(x, b) = 1^x b^1 + 2^x b^2 + 3^x b^3 + 4^x b^4 + …

There's a thing going around where an Indian claimed years ago to have solved the Riemann hypothesis and the Indian press is now breathlessly repeating it, and of course he didn't. Fine, whatever. That happens all the time. But it's an excuse to discuss the Riemann zeta function.

The Riemann Hypothesis is a mathematical problem that has remained unsolved for 161 years—until mathematical physicist Kumar Eswaran from Hyderabad did it. It took five years for an expert committee to approve the proof -- and a $1 million prize:  https://deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/280621/hyderabad-math-wizard-solves-reimann-hypothesis.html

The reason τ comes up a lot is that it is the conversion factor between two natural units for measuring angles, the revolution and the radian. In contexts where that is salient, τ is indeed the most natural thing. In other contexts, whatever, talk about whatever's salient there.

If you are doing something that involves both trigonometry and calculus, τ is very likely to be the quantity in this space of most natural interest, because the revolution and radian are both very salient there. In other contexts, maybe something else.

Glass is the most worthless material. It breaks easily, eating it kills you, and you can't even see it. Light passes right through it. The guy who invented glass got a hell of a chewing out from his boss.

Great. Bill Cosby (actor from The Cosby Show) gets out of prison just as Allison Mack (actress who played Alex Mack) goes in. The 80s turn to the 90s. Prison is a few decades behind. In about ten years, they'll get actors from 2000s shows.

I like mundane problems that can be solved just by paying money. I still don't solve them because I've internalized the idea that it is immoral and anti-socialist to exchange money for goods or services, but at least I know exactly how to solve them if I ever desperately need to.

The number of cycles in a permutations, subtracted from the number of elements, tells us the minimum number of transpositions to get from this permutation to identity, and any other way of doing so again has length this plus some even value.

Basically, it's easy to see that the n-th exterior power of a k-dimensional space is S^(k choose n), where S is either the scalars or the scalars mod 2. S is the scalars if odd many swaps can't yield identity, but it's the scalars mod 2 otherwise. Luckily, the former happens.

Knowing that permutation parity is well-defined with the usual properties, it is then easy to show that this tentative definition of the n-th exterior power does indeed satisfy the universal property characteristic of being the n-th exterior power.

Yes, it's easy to show the only potential obstacle to the n-th exterior power of a k-dimensional space being (k choose n) dimensional is the issue of permutation parity, and once we know permutations have a well-defined parity, that obstacle melts away.

If we could do some odd sequence of transpositions and come back to where we started, such a product would have to equal its own negation, and thus it would indeed be equal to zero (or, over the integers rather than over the rationals, it would have 2-torsion).

No, for the exact reason I noted above. It's easy to show that there's a generating set given by the (k choose n) many exterior products of n many basis elements, in some canonical order. But it's not obvious these values are nonzero (over a field, or torsion-free in general).

I've never been on the verge of marriage so what do I know, but the way people are tut-tutting about "Why hasn't he married her yet after four years? Why is he treating her this way?" seems insane to me. They really think a long-term couple doesn't determine their plans together?

This sequence of nested open intervals (x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., with x0 < x1 < x2 < … < y2 < y1 < y0 has the property that the intersection of all these intervals is a non-empty interval of reals, with at most one value in common with S.

Keep scrolling through S until you've found two values which fall strictly within the current interval. These become the endpoints of the next interval. Do this over and over. This yields a sequence of nested intervals (possibly ending at some point, possibly continuing forever).

The tetrahedron, cube, and octahedron were known since time immemorial. As for the other Platonic solids, the ancient Greeks discovered the dodecahedron by looking at pyrite crystals (which often take on this arrangement) and the icosahedron by examining the T4 bacteriophage.

As it is both my birthday and election day, I have been made mayor of New York. I did not wish for this. It is a fucking hassle. It will continue for the next four years, after which the next election will be held, on June 22, my birthday, reinstating me likewise to office.

I will be re-attempting my never-yet-successful dosa cart ambitions for my birthday. If there's time, I will also vote in the mayoral thing, but I'll be honest. Birthdays are for not doing stuff you don't want to.
