Text: Music is unbearable to listen to, with my favorite artists worst of the lot, naturally. After all, I spent so much time cheering myself up with it during the most painful periods in my life. The associations are too strong. I've Ludovicoed myself out of the medium.

Text: @JortsAuthority If my tweet should happen to ever go viral, I endorse this as its "Wow, this really blew up! While you're here, check out..." companion link. (But my tweet had better go viral. This is conditional endorsement.)

Text: I genuinely believe the solution to this sort of bullshit is that college should not have merit-based admission, or significantly selective admission at all. I hardly see why things should be set up this way, with this scarcity mindset for education. https://t.co/EIGkULGuRD

Text: Of course, people aren't genuinely chasing education, as such, but rather, credentials, whose zero-sum value comes from their gatekeeping. That's the system. (I'm repeating points I've already said, because I feel like repeating myself.)

Text: I used to love Douglas Adams, but haven't re-read him in years. But I'd hate for it to turn out he's Bad. Like Python et al, I hope the way a bunch of nerdy dipshits enjoy him doesn't rule out how nerdy non-dipshits could enjoy him too. Anything good attracts a spectrum of fans.

Text: @rogerbellin I kept struggling and struggling and ultimately gave in to the character count, knowing this would happen, and making my peace with it.

Text: @martsendo Somewhat related is the matter of how I feel about some work not merely enjoyed by but in fact produced by authors who are themselves in many ways dipshits or worse. But that is a conversation it would be very, very difficult to get into on Twitter.

Text: @rogerbellin More confirmation of the downsides of tweeting. I refuse to stand idly by as anyone defends Perl.

Text: Looking back at my life, reflecting on various "Sliding Doors" moments (the first time I heard about Sliding Doors (1998); the first time I saw Sliding Doors (1998); oh, this one instance in which I wrote a tweet about Sliding Doors (1998), my finger hovering over the buttonâ€¦).
