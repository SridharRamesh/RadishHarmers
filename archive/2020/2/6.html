<pre>Last weekend, you&#39;d have been an idiot if you claimed what today is math fact. Did something change? Yes, some caucus results came out. And if you correctly anticipated those results? You were being wrong. But now you&#39;re right. This seismograph is useful and has actionable value. https://t.co/Y9dAohkLYy</pre>
