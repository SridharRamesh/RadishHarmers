Text: Proud of myself when I'm super garrulous, and also proud of myself when I sit back quietly, yielding to others to instead dominate the oxygen in the room. Either way, I'm displaying my fine skills of discernment. I'm constantly making the correct decisions others screw up.

Text: If I said something weird to you at a bar: it's noisy and my hearing is bad and half the time I'm just guessing at what I'm replying to. 

If I said something weird to you not at a bar: I was distracted, still trying to figure out what someone said to me at a bar the other night.

Text: Sitting alone in my room, late at night, I begin to worry. Do I have any redeeming values at all? Am I any good? I take a quick vote, so I can know for sure. 1 For, 0 Against. Unanimous as always. Phew. I continue the evening, spring in my step, smiling with my mandate.

Text: Cannot believe the things I am hearing; frankly, I must now reconsider my dues-paying membership, no longer confident this organization has the basic expertise to ever achieve what I hoped. I joined the Flat Earth Society assuming we all understood this as an aspirational goal.

Text: @kathbarbadoro Definitely a cryptoracist policy, barely crypto, but also, race notwithstanding, anyone who wants dreadlocks or any other hairstyle should be able to w/o job worries. Whites with dreads are fine, in the grand scheme; bosses who itch to control others' hair are the awful ones.

Text: @kathbarbadoro I feel like this is saying whites who partake of traditionally nonwhite fashions are doing something unethical, in a way I wouldn't agree with. I feel like even if no white ever chose to wear dreads, bosses who want to discriminate would go right on doing so with same legal ease.

Text: So much crudity from me lately. Could raise charges of edgelordery. I need to take time to focus on sweet jokes, little logic puzzles, stuff I could show my parents. Must make sure it's all clever, not mere frisson. Sometimes that comes in such package, sometimes it doesn't.
