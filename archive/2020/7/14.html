<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ned_flaczynski I sympathize with you, but one might feel &quot;This statement is not strictly true, it&#39;s either strictly false or neither strictly true nor strictly false&quot; paradoxical even if considered as neither strictly true nor strictly false, as it seems that would then make it strictly true.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ned_flaczynski It&#39;s easy to see how that bothers people. I have sympathy for saying something like what you&#39;ve said as an explanation of what&#39;s going on, but there&#39;s some subtlety in saying this in a way that puts people at ease from the clear source of unease here.</p></blockquote>

I am joking in saying the Irish were slaves. Everyone in my circles of Twitter, such as @Sturgeons_Law, understands this as a stock foolish thing people say.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ned_flaczynski The unsettling thing is this:<br><br>If it&#39;s neither strictly true nor strictly false, it would seem to follow that it IS strictly true. It explicitly said, if that happened, it should be true.<br><br>But if it IS strictly true, then it&#39;s not (neither strictly true nor false).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ned_flaczynski So it seems like we are faced again with a contradiction, if we start off taking it as neither strictly true nor false.<br><br>Maybe that&#39;s fine. Maybe you are happy to accept such contradictions as fine. But being unsettled is a human emotion. You can&#39;t add axioms to remove emotions.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ned_flaczynski It should also be noted how these antinomies still produce explosive inconsistency even in contexts that explicitly refrain from claiming all things are either strictly true or strictly false, like intuitionistic logic. The antinomies remain antinomies in intuitinoistic logic.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ned_flaczynski Yeah, maybe. It&#39;s certainly the case that some logicians and laypeople still ponder the paradoxes while most logicians and laypeople just sort of shrug them aside. But that was also true even circa 1900.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ned_flaczynski Even circa 1900 when all this was raging, these discoveries were thousands of years old (consider Epimenides), just suddenly fashionable again because of formal logic. Slow digestion.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ned_flaczynski I think the real thing is that formal logic overall became very fashionable for a brief period, and is now again no longer such a hot topic, and the hotness of the paradoxes rose and fell with that ride.</p></blockquote>
