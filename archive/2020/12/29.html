<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@pablum_man @flglmn Getting offended about &quot;blind spot&quot; is dumb. That&#39;s the sort of thing that would often annoy me. But it&#39;s no great crime to be a little dumb and silly in that way. Suggesting immigrants need to shut up or get the boot is a hundred times worse.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@htpyFiber I think that&#39;s potentially a good exercise, if you pose to the children that there might be a clever way to do it (instead of doing it like a time-wasting prank). I think it&#39;s something kids could figure out on their own if encouraged to do so, and that it would be fun to do so.</p></blockquote>
