Text: No "partner"s for me, thanks. I mean, sounds nice, but, I know my lane; I shall not stray. Only "the old ball and chain", as is traditional for my people.

Text: The baby everyone thinks is markedly un-cute looks like a cute baby to me. It's an unusual angle and pose and captured mid-fright, but my powerful brain can accommodate for that and transpose to ordinary contexts (the same skills I used to crack the mystery of the colored dress).
