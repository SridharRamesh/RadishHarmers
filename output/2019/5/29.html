Text: [Bloody and bruised]
I'll never tell! You'll get nothing from me!

[I am punched again. My captor nods to his assistant, who readies a knife.]
No! No, my top 5 favorite movies are a secret I will take to the grave!

[The assistant smiles, and shortly after, my screams ring out.]

Text: Can't stand those restaurants with signs like “No wifey here - just talk to each other like the old days :)”. I love my wife very much and will not disrespect her by bonding with others, thus starting down the road to an emotional affair. No sir.

Text: I know I've made a good joke when it doesn't quote or screenshot anyone and might still be funny in twenty years or two. I do what it takes to pay the bills, I make tentpoles for the studio to subsidize the rarer passion projects for myself, but I know my wheat from my chaff.

Text: @Signal_Hill_Oil @trev_drinkwater @nobody_stop_me Having goals or experiencing hope is anti-worker. It is for this reason that I have no aspirations beyond posting, thus demonstrating my true socialist bona fides.

Text: @Signal_Hill_Oil @trev_drinkwater @nobody_stop_me You're right. When the revolution comes, first up against the wall will be the factory owners and anyone who ever made an audition tape.

Text: @peligrietzer @hii_nal I'm not against it, but one could just as well make a whole new list, at that point. To make precisely three insertions out of 100 (and the other two so near the end) is surprising.

Text: Whenever an alcohol marketing executive hears someone say "I don't drink", why, they beam with pride. What a brand coup for alcohol, managing to capture the generic; the direct opposite of Kleenex, Xerox, etc.'s woes. The advertising manager for edibles deserves a raise as well.

Text: I don't trust autobiographies. They can be so selective; the author is too biased, including only the details they wish to be remembered. Lincoln's, JFK's, Amelia Earhart's; all leave out major, important facts.
