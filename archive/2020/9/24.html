<pre>The fact that emotions are physical is wild. Crying and erections and blushing and so on. It should not be possible. Descartes is physically rolling in his grave.</pre>

<pre>@wokeberia I made it turn up by flipping coins a lot the day RBG died. Cheating in spirit though not in law. It was unwise, though. My relationship to this site genuinely brings out many poor qualities of mine, albeit also some alright qualities.</pre>
