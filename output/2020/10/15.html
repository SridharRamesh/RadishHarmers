Text: @wcthunderesq @hobbsure1 @SweetEggPerson I agree that these are stupid mindsets, but on the strictly ecological point, isn't white sage distinct from sage and native to the Americas (to the extent anything is native to anywhere)?

Text: @Sturgeons_Law Not that strange when you consider that "libertarian" has come to mean something like "propertarian". For a libertarian to want a private corporation to be able to do whatever it wants is no great surprise. https://t.co/M6LY51bQUM

Text: Sci-fi show hires a linguist to make a detailed conlang for it and train its actors accordingly. But the linguist has a strong Geordie accent, so all the aliens end up with a strong Geordie accent.

Text: They say cops and child molesters have it bad in prison, but that's nothing. The vicious Prisoner Killer did not fare long in prison before being viciously killed by prisoners, who loathed him for his crime of vicious prisoner-killing.

Text: If you do enough good deeds, you come back in your next life as God. You displace the existing God into a realm of eternal torment beyond the ability of language to describe. It is great, for a while.

Text: Classic rock band performing. Audience starts singing along. Band relents to let audience sing a line. Then two lines. Then the audience takes over the instruments. Audience handling engineering, audience as roadies. Audience fucking groupies, the works. Madness. Unacceptable.

Text: The Bermuda Triangle is defined by three edges, between Miami, San Juan, and Bermuda. The Bermuda triangle includes Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and large parts of the Americas. It is heavily feared in aeronautical circles, as home to the majority of aviation accidents.

Text: @ConnorSouthard Its first season was tremendous because it slowly surprised you by not being the show it starts out looking like it is. Later seasons were less interesting, because that surprise was no longer available, and also for the usual reasons shows become bad.

Text: @AliceFromQueens I understand what odds are, or are supposed to be, and I gripe with Nate Silver. Declaring prediction odds on one-off events in the way he does yields no actionable information, especially as they end up defended in such a way as to be taken as unfalsifiable.

Text: @FrogsStalingrad @CODYWlNFREY Alright, but what do odds mean in this context? For example, suppose one person says Hillary has a 70% chance of winning and another person says Hillary has a 25% chance of winning. Is one of them right and the other wrong? How do we adjudicate who is right and who is wrong?
