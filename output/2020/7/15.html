Text: @legalizecringe I actually know the script, but I don't do anything with it. Sometimes I'll see a bit of Tamil that's clearly spelling out a borrowed English word, that's fun, but that's it.

Text: @DKThomp Wow! A candidate like this doesn't come along every four years. A once in a lifetime opportunity.

Text: @but_rly_tho Christ, yeah, that would've been a pithier post. I am thrilled to hear of the most progressive agenda in modern US history, with public promises including "What John McCain did in 2008" + "What George H. W. Bush did in 1991".

Text: @mattcasey No formal power, and in terms of informal influence, Cheney is rather an exception. No one can name three things any other Vice President did. Pence hasn't done anything, Biden didn't do anything, Gore barely, Quayle, GHW qua VP, Mondale, Rockefeller, Ford qua VP, Agnewâ€¦

Text: @dannyburt33 "Biden will follow in McCain's footsteps for this election and then, if the rumors are true (and who the fuck knows), might step aside while someone else runs for election next time" is not strong grounds for claiming the most progressive agenda in history.
