Text: Is there such a thing as two-way parasociality? I feel like that's a thing, I feel like that's the very thing I mostly get out of this site, simulacrum enough to keep me from leaving but not enough to satisfy, but I can't flesh it out in 280. You get the idea, I'm sure.

Text: Maybe I want a different word than "parasociality", technically, but I think this post still effectively communicates the gist I am trying to communicate.

Text: @yeetphilosopher Such a visually arresting but pedagogically unlikely to be helpful way to explain two-input logic gates that take (False, False) to False.

Text: @sigfpe @yeetphilosopher I agree with your second sentence, which is how I feel as well. Re: your first sentence, I'm not sure if you're taking issue with my post? I'm not saying they don't explain why (False, False) goes to False; I'm saying they don't well generalize beyond illustrating such operators.

Text: @yeetphilosopher @sigfpe Precisely. But I see now how my wording (playing off the original post's caption) could be confusing.

Text: @sigfpe @yeetphilosopher Whereas the operator tables these illustrations are meant to clarify (??) are actually simpler to understand and generalize cleanly far further (to arbitrary other operations, of arbitrary arity, on arbitrary possible input and output values).

Text: @yeetphilosopher @sigfpe The water rendering looks nice. That's kind of cool. (Dan perhaps has better-informed opinions about that than me üòÄ.)

Text: @karenhincks @joekeskold @ScottMcDonnell_ @bornflawless @BostonCollege @boston25 No. That wouldn't fall under the scope of a manslaughter charge. It would have to be tried as womanslaughter.

Text: @yeetphilosopher @2dead2tired @theirfanator @SarahGrynpas @pizza_91 What was the value of assigning numbers to the outcome of the 2016 election in this way? What is the value of making non-predictions that cannot be relied on?

Text: @yeetphilosopher @2dead2tired @theirfanator @SarahGrynpas @pizza_91 The only reason anyone cares about Nate's machine is because they want to use it as a prediction, and the defense is that it isn't one, it's just a numbers station.

Text: @yeetphilosopher @2dead2tired @theirfanator @SarahGrynpas @pizza_91 Yes. Though a bit odd to make this argument when you yourself said attempting to do so by listening to such machines actually led to poor decisions about how to apportion campaign resources and funds. But had one known beforehand that Silver would be better than Wang, perhaps‚Ä¶
