Text: @Sturgeons_Law For certain mindsets, this is also part of the appeal of wonkery. It's more interesting than something simple and boring. (But all this stuff is mindset dependent. For another mindset, the aesthetics will be such as to enjoy what the other had considered "boring" and vice versa.)

Text: @Sturgeons_Law Ah, I thought I was agreeing with you (I was conceiving the "wonk" as driven by a contrarian/must-not-be-boring instinct as well, in contrast to the "radical"), but the way this reply is worded suggest you didn't see it that way.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law Though also, what is considered "contrarian" depends on starting point. Many would consider the radical "contrarian", as contrary to the status quo. But there's a difference between reflexive contrarianness, as some seem to exhibit, and simply an unpopular position, presumably.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law Still, one can be contrarian to the status quo, or contrarian to the supposed consensus of the radicals by embracing the status quo, or so on and so on. Milieu-dependent, I should say perhaps, rather than starting point. Anyway, @infiniteaviary already touched on this.

Text: @Sturgeons_Law @infiniteaviary 280 characters sucks. I hate trying to discuss anything on Twitter, having to figure out how to contort each new pair of sentences to such boxes. Bring back macroblogs and their comments. I'll stick to being Henny Youngman here.
