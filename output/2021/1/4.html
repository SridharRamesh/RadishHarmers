Text: I'm trying to remember the bathroom tile patterns of my childhood. I stared at them for a decade and a half, I should have this down. Fuck! I am their last chance. Without me, they are lost to the ether. Where is my grid paper? I need to jog some memories.

Text: @Lizarus0 @ConceptualJames @eugenegu @jk_rowling But the spectrum of a linear operator CAN take on 18 discrete values that aren't totally ordered (18 different complex eigenvalues, say). That's a very normal thing for a spectrum of a linear operator to do. That makes this weird angry pedantry particularly amusing.
