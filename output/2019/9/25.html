Text: @marx_knopfler It's too late at night for me to conceptualize the number zero, which mankind struggled for millennia to grasp. Are you saying you use these on the highest length or lowest length setting?

Text: @marx_knopfler I barely ever use it. I normally just clean shave with a manual razor every few days instead. But I keep having this fantasy I will learn to use this stubble trimmer to achieve precisely the effect I desire. However, as the OP shows, this is tough, as I do not know what I desire.
