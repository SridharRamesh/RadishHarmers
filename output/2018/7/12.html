Text: @christapeterso I'd probably travel each year to spend my birthday with my parents instead of with friends, in this situation. Perhaps they'd fondly enjoy this reminder of halcyon days, or perhaps they'd grow quite tired of it. Similarly me with my own kids. Any shared birthdays would be hell.
