Text: I used to make sure never to kill insects or bugs; only ever to carefully capture them and release them outside. Now, I'm lazier. I don't know that I can justify this. I bare my sins publicly and hope for redemption. (But I bare them in a language only humans understand.)

Text: Geoffrey, no, you sweet naif. What you mean to say is something like that no person is better than another; I'm with you on that. But those things you are describing? They include some very significant ways in which some jobs are better than others! https://t.co/an1mv4f961

Text: @sethiankit This kind of carping (from the prescriptivists; and about "chai tea" and such as well) always struck me as myopic. Do people not say "pita bread" and such? Is not the "pepper" in "chili pepper" redundant? It's fine. It all totally fine.

Text: Keep it simple: Build a strong universal welfare state, and just tax the wealthy because they're wealthy. Don't bother linking tax levels to minutiae of formal employer-employee relations; isn't that the kind of process that got us our employer-linked healthcare boondoggle?

Text: The BEZOS Act would explicitly incentivize corporations to push for slashing the quantity and quality of benefits provided by the welfare state (even moreso than in the current regime). Seems a myopic framing to adopt.
