Text: If you feel people aren't paying enough attention to issue X, go ahead and bring issue X to their attention, but I don't see what use it does to complain that they pay attention to issue Y, and to impugn Y as not worthy of redress because it isn't X.

Text: @YangVentures A million things that happen all the time in the discourse. Currently, a certain amount of backlash I'm seeing to people voicing worries over the teardown of net neutrality. But it will be something else tomorrow, and something else after that, and this tweet will be evergreen.

Text: Back in AIM days, I had a very specific system of differentiating haha, hahaha, heh, hehe, heheh, hehehe, LOL, etc. True friends understood.

Meanwhile, crude enemies just "LOL"ed at will, whether or not actually laughing aloud. No integrity. No care for fine discernment.
