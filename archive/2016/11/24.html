<pre>@Dennisnh @AlgebraFact x^n = 1 has ≤ n roots in a field. Any such finite abelian group is cyclic (via fundamental thm of fin. abelian grps).</pre>

<pre>@Dennisnh @AlgebraFact In nutshell: either 0 or phi(n) elements of order precisely n. Sum of phi(n) over proper divisors of |G| is &amp;lt; |G|.</pre>

<pre>Proof (uniqueness): Field elements roots of x^(p^n) = x [by Lagrange]. So field consists of these roots in unique algebraic closure of Z_p.</pre>
