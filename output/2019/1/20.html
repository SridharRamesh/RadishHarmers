Text: 100% of people who write for television, or even work for TV production in any capacity, are gibbering morons. Yet I love TV more than I love myself? The medium in theory, if not its actual toothless, trite content? Shed your childish attachments, Sridhar. Take up bridge or such.

Text: I could never actually take up bridge. I'd need three friends (indeed, two baseline-level friends and one truly close friend). Competitive Klondike's the game for me.

Text: Telling stories at the party, namedropping. Mostly namedropping kids from my high school. They didn't go on to do anything notable, but man, they've got some great names. Come to think of it, a lot of these are urban legends, and pretty racist. I hope I meet a celeb someday.
