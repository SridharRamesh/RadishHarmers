Text: I stuff my dreams in a can and keep them on my desk at the office, to glance at from time to time when I need a smile. I come in on Monday and find that the cleaning staff has accidentally discarded it. Doesn't get me down. Good thing I made that backup can.

Text: I think I've about hit the ceiling on where I can go with my existing mode; voice, style, sense of humor. One mustn't play the same tune for so long; things are only entertaining when they're original. I'll seek new formulas, but I'm afraid it will take some time to devise them.

Text: Why can't I slam my middle finger fast enough against my palm to create a snapping sound on its own? Why do I need to bring the tease and release of my thumb into it? It's still my same energy and muscles responsible, surely.
