<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@OSINTwannabe @LethalityJane Wikipedia says yes, and tells me he was fiercely anti-Communist. I imagine I would not care for his politics at all. But if you save so many lives like this, that is still a great accomplishment which deserves celebration.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@robertskmiles @plain_simon You can use descriptive variable names within conventional mathematical notation too. It&#39;s just a dumb cultural thing that mathematicians don&#39;t do it. Granted, perhaps that makes it not conventional mathematical notation then, by definition. But you see what I mean.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@plain_simon @robertskmiles Why would descriptive variable names make that unpleasant? Code is also designed to be manipulated and refactored and that&#39;s precisely the value descriptive variable names bring to it.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@htpyFiber I think actually most people don&#39;t get taught in high school what these symbols mean, and that&#39;s why they find them scary. Not that there&#39;s any reason to be scared of some small unfamiliar word or notation you can learn, but I think that&#39;s the phenomenon.</p></blockquote>
