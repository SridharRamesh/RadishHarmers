Text: RT @RadishHarmers: Large salary's the lazy one. "Oh, I so hate working; you'd have to pay me loads to make me do it". Working for peanuts?…

Text: Falling over with praise and admiration at rich guys for making large donations is just "He was a great man. Not only did he have opinions on how the world should be, but also… [choking up a bit] he also had $$$!".

Text: @twitersgoodboy @MichaelRobnalt Twitter search is honestly really bad now, much worse than it was not even that long ago. I constantly cannot find tweets with Twitter search that I later confirm did indeed exist. I don't know what's going on.

Text: @twitersgoodboy @MichaelRobnalt Yup, I've noticed that as well! But even when I do that, I still often end up not finding particular tweets that did indeed exist, even as other tweet matching the keywords may pop up.

Text: @sodburger There's no more to it than that "Thai Pongal" sounds like "Tide Podgal".

(Full disclosure: as a substandard Tamilian, I'd never really been aware of the phrase "Thai Pongal" before today, but apparently it's a standard way of referencing the holiday with reference to its month.)
