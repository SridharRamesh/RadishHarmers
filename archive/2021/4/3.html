<pre>@capet_louis Picking the seeds is such a pain. But I&#39;ve discovered a store near me stocks containers of pre-picked fresh pomegranate seeds. I know it&#39;s perhaps bougie to pay for such a thing instead of just picking them myself, but it is divine. And so I must deny myself its pleasure.</pre>

<pre>Low-hanging fruit. Several predecessors can be found, on top of which the only real innovation is fitting to a template (which in itself is the definition of formula). I used to have integrity about avoiding doing anything so obvious. Well, have fun with it.</pre>

<pre>Neil Armstrong made constant fun of Buzz Aldrin&#39;s looks. &quot;Your nose is so big, I can see it from outer space&quot;, he jibed throughout their approach to the moon.
