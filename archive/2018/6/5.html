But it would be dishonest for me to pretend I do things. At the moment, in true mathematician style, all my doing is merely hypothetical.</p></blockquote>

A celeb dies, so, as folks do, she looks for a connection to them when expressing condolence; some way to honor their accomplishments, to note some happiness their work put in her life.
