Text: @evanewashington @jackeselbst Adding Peirce's law won't do anything, you can already derive Peirce's law in the system as is. You can derive any tautology phrased using only implication. But yes, just adding bottom (aka, False) and the axiom "bottom -&gt; A" would work.

Text: @jackeselbst Ignoring 0-ary business, you can give a single axiom in terms of NAND (or just as well NOR), taking equational reasoning rather than modus ponens as our derivation rule. See https://t.co/gLho50mR5r. It's horribly unwieldy to do the derivations showing this works, as can be seen.

Text: @jackeselbst When you say you have no use for classical logic beyond playing around, do you mean you're committed exclusively to intuitionistic logic or some other such logic in a non-merely-playing sense, or do you mean something else?

Text: @jackeselbst It means that instead of your basic assertions being Boolean expressions and your basic rule being "From p and p ⊃ q, derive q, for any expressions p and q", now the basic assertions are equations between Boolean expressions, and your basic rules are that

Text: @jackeselbst "You can freely derive p = p" and "From the equation p = q and any other equation E, you can also derive any modification of E created by replacing some instances of p within it by q", where p and q are any expressions and E is any equation between expressions.

Text: @jackeselbst I agree that there's no One True Logic. You can make up whatever rules you want and see what happens, and maybe they describe something else you're interested in, maybe they're just neat and you like thinking about them in themselves. I don't disagree with what you just said.

Text: @jackeselbst And when people try to find the formal logic underlying natural language, demonstrating "Aha! It's THIS instead of THAT, because people say sentences like this sometimes…", it's pretty misguided to me. But I have philosopher friends I can't say this around either.

Text: @jackeselbst So now the things you derive are like "p &amp; q = q &amp; p" or "p &amp; (r v s) = (p &amp; r) v (p &amp; s)". If you're not accustomed to thinking of equations, this might be weird, but if you want to say some formula always evaluates to True, you can just say it equals any other such formula.

Text: @jackeselbst And conversely, you could turn any such equation into the conjunction of two converse implications, and saying the equation holds is as good as saying that bi-implication always evaluates to True.

Text: @jackeselbst But equational reasoning (or its close cousin of A ≤ B reasoning) lends itself more naturally to axiomatizing lots of other things in math, structures that aren't Boolean algebra or meant to be any kind of "logic" of "truth values" at all.

Text: @asmeurer Thinking of everything in logic as though built up in terms of NAND only makes it harder, not easier, to reason. I don't know if modern circuitry is built up in terms of NAND or NOR or what, but logic is not particularly about circuitry. That just happens to be one instantiation.

Text: @asmeurer There is no fundamental building block. The rules you are interested in are directly what they are, in themselves. AND is, in itself, the thing that follows AND's rules. There's no need or gain in thinking of it as a complex of NANDs, in general. And so on.

Text: @asmeurer Indeed, my sense is that AND, OR, and NOT gates are most typically made directly, not out of NAND gates. But this is just a fact about electronics manufacturing, about electrons and silicon and factory costs, not about logic. Perhaps in hydraulic computing, it is different.

Text: @EthnicSteve The proportion of children who are in school but don't yet know how to read is very small, that's like kindergarten and first grade, so the vast majority of schooling isn't about that.

Text: @EthnicSteve As for that narrow age band of children in school who don't yet know how to read, fine, for this one particular skill we may wish to develop early, perhaps there's some special discussion to be had. Remote learning may not be ideal, but I don't see why it would be so terrible.

Text: @EthnicSteve I don't know that mathematical literacy is more artificial than literacy literacy, but sure, these both are not intrinsic. But I have a dim view of what school accomplishes in math education. I have an extremely dim view of what early grades spend their time on in math education.

Text: @levon_whiteguy @EthnicSteve But I will readily grant that parenting is exhausting and sharing the load via daycare is welcome. I just think bundling discussions of school's role qua daycare with discussions of school's role qua education is obfuscating.

Text: @EthnicSteve @levon_whiteguy The nature of a pandemic is that socialization goes down. It's unfortunate, a pandemic is unfortunate. It's true schools currently play a huge role in feeding kids, but it's odd we've set the world up this way where children can't get fed just as well at home.

Text: @_me_you_coward @jackeselbst If it interests you, I cannot argue it is uninteresting to you, such is the nature of interest. But to me, it is not very interesting, because it is very arbitrary.

Text: @_me_you_coward @jackeselbst For example, we are here talking a lot about a single axiom which can produce the logic using only the derivation rule of Modus Ponens (that from p and p→q, you can derive q). Well, why should Modus Ponens be our basic derivation rule?

Text: @_me_you_coward @jackeselbst We could say our basic derivation rule is that, from P[with variable p replaced by False and simplifying constant expressions] and P[with p replaced by True and simplifying constant expressions], you can derive P simpliciter. This lets us get away with one axiom: True.

Text: @_me_you_coward @jackeselbst We can modify this rule a little and get away with zero axioms, even (you can derive anything whose truth table is all true). The line between axiom and derivation rule is arbitrary, it does not carve reality at the joints, so axiom-counting is arbitrary as well.

Text: @_me_you_coward @jackeselbst Similarly, for one axiom vs. multiple axioms, in many contexts this is very arbitrary. You can alwys take axioms A, B, C, D, …, and turn them into a single axiom A &amp; B &amp; C &amp; D…, as long as you have a derivation rule that lets you derive individual conjuncts from a conjunction.

Text: @_me_you_coward @jackeselbst In this particular context, we happen to be limiting the form of our derivation rules so that we aren't given this for free. Why not? Deriving A from A &amp; B is surely every bit as natural as deriving B from A and A -&gt; B. Well, we're just making it up arbitrarily.

Text: @_me_you_coward @jackeselbst One can be interested in an arbitrary question, one can be interested in anything. But it is to me like being very invested in the question of whether 7581735203 is prime (albeit harder). You can generate arbitrary questions without end, so no particular one is that interesting.

Text: @sclv I'd say there's some big, basic concepts. Of course, they are obvious: categories, functors, natural transformations, isomorphisms, adjunctions, terminal objects, universal properties, etc.
