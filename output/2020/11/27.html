Text: @DylanGelula We're only recent mutuals. You'll get Thanksgiving well-wishes from me next year.

Text: Marie Kondo created the "one of them has got to go" meme. Remember? From a hundred years ago? Happy Thanksgiving.

Text: Finding Benford's law in everything is the mathematician's version of finding the golden ratio in everything. Every cloud is your favorite shape if you squint.

Text: @sigfpe You're right, it's a little inapt. What I would say is this: Does Benford's law hold, or does "the magnitude of the deviation from uniformity of log(X) modulo a relatively small quantity is not very large" hold?

Text: @sigfpe There's a sense in which these are equivalent, but the former phrasing suggests an actual process in nature generating log-uniform values (which can happen, that's one kind of distribution and sometimes the relevant one, but

Text: @sigfpe there's no reason to expect everything to have that distribution as a general fact about nature or logic), while the latter phrasing encompasses what I feel is the reality:

Text: @sigfpe That there's all kinds of distributions that look Benfordy to some degree of tolerance because lots of things look like lots of things at lots of scales.

Text: @sigfpe How clear is it that these things should be thought of as specifically Benford and not log-normal, say? Perhaps the real law should be that we expect log-normality with large variance. Yet that's a different law.

Text: @sigfpe I feel like singling out this particular type of distribution and saying "Yeah, it's a law, empirical data tends to be Benfordy. If it isn't, you should be suspicious" is like saying "Yeah, it's a law, numbers tend to be 3. If you see a number that isn't 3, be suspicious".

Text: @sigfpe It's true, lots of numbers are 3, and if you go looking for 3s, you'll find them, but it's no general law about the nature of empirical data. That's just one thing that can happen. And if you really want to see 3s, you'll even see them where the thing is better described as Ï€.

Text: @jcreed It looks like you allow 0-ary, 1-ary, and 2-ary branching, but don't care about order. So if we restrict to finite sets, this is the free symmetric monoidal category with an object X and maps from X^0, X^1, and X^2 to X.

Text: @jcreed To allow infinite sets, we add that our symmetric monoidal category has infinitary monoidal products, in the natural appropriate sense.

Text: @jcreed Oh, I forgot to say, for ignoring order, we add the condition that the map out of X^2 is symmetric.
