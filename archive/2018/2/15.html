<pre>Been waiting half an hour for a Lyft to get to the BART to go home from work. One said he was here, then said he couldn&#39;t find the building, then cancelled. Another showed up, I got in, he suddenly yelled at me and said I closed his car door too fast (?!), and told me to get out.</pre>

<pre>I follow a lot of strangers online who hate each other. I have many better things to do than stay up-to-date with the ongoing drama of nichely well-known Netfolk whose ages I blew past years ago. But, I&#39;m trying to figure out the right kids to shit on as well. I want to nail it.</pre>

<pre>Many years ago, my kid cousins made me those arts and crafts things ironed together from beads. I&#39;ve kept them in my various laptop bags, etc. I lost one when I was mugged. Another, to the ravages of time, or so for its integrity, yet I still find stray beads from it, even now.</pre>

<pre>Hours later, irrelevantly, this still kinda bums me out, per my idiom. Fuck off, random Lyft guy; I got in your car totally normally and you were a weirdo asshole to me. (My only consolation is that you follow me on Twitter and will see this excoriation…) https://t.co/CwlsemZ1t1</pre>

<pre>@christapeterso I&#39;ve had so many tense interactions with strangers for completely inexplicable reasons recently. Just last Friday, a guy in front of me on the BART started yelling at me and threatened to smash a bottle into my face (and again, at first, I thought it was somehow my fault…).</pre>

<pre>@christapeterso I&#39;d guess BART guy was unwell, but I didn&#39;t realize it until well into &quot;Huh? Oh, I&#39;m sorry, sir; did I accidentally do something I ought apologize for? Wait, wha— Oh, fuck, how do I get out of this situation? Just look at the ground and don&#39;t say anything till he leaves…&quot; panic.</pre>

<pre>@_Pinback It&#39;s at least standardly pronounced that way, which is another thing Westerners almost always assume differently.

(Granted, pronunciation varies across any large group of people; I shouldn&#39;t imply there is only one pronunciation among Hindus either.)</pre>
