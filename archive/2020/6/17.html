Anyone who knows what multiplication means can repeatedly add to work such tables out for themselves, if they ever need to. Why force fast rote recall drills? Pointless ritual, like much of school.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@chipwytch @ComradeLuanne @paul__hanger You understand multiplication MORE rigorously by computing the &quot;times table&quot; for yourself, rather than blindly memorizing it as handed down from above. It demonstrates MORE understanding of math to say &quot;7 x 3 = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21&quot; than to say &quot;7 x 3 = 21 because the table said so&quot;.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@chipwytch @ComradeLuanne @paul__hanger Memorizing the times table does not sharpen vague understanding or improve arguments. The only goal it serves is speed. But when speed is required, it is superseded by using a calculator. So, pointless middle frustration. Understand the concepts, and know how to use a calculator.</p></blockquote>
