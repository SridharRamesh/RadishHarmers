Text: @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath Surely lots of people do, or at any rate, refrain from saying the "real" Set must be classical. "Set" is a marker for the category of sets in whatever metalogic you wish to use. When your metalogic is intuitionistic, then the internal logic of Set has intuitionistic logic.

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath No, I disagree. [There may be some confusion caused by people often speaking of choice, LEM, etc, in toposes in an "external" sense by default, but what's relevant for this conversation is the internal logic, and really, that's what these should all mean by default anyway]

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath The subobject classifier will be the powerset of the one element set, and this definitely will not be isomorphic to the two-element set in an intuitionistic set theory such as IZF. In that sense, the internal logic is intuitionistic, not classical.

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath Mind you, when I say "Set" now, I mean the category Set defined internal to IZF. 

FWIW, as a sidenote, there's also another topos which I consider often the actual right thing to look at, though I wouldn't call it "Set" in the same way, which is [cont.]

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath the topos in the meta-meta-logic where we are discussing IZF, whose (countable set of) objects are the formulas provably defining sets in IZF, and whose morphisms between these are the formulas provably defining functions between them, up to provable equality.

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath The filter-quotient construction is only necessary if you want to make the thing externally two-valued (so that Hom(1, 1 + 1) = 1 + 1, with the 1 + 1 on the right being in the metalogic within which we are discussing the topos).

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath You pick an ultrafilter on the Boolean algebra Hom(1, 1+ 1) and quotient.

But our purpose here is the internal logic, for which this externally valued Hom-functor doesn't matter; in the internal logic, the double negation sheaves topos will automatically be Boolean even without

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath This distinction amounts to the difference between "Theory T either proves or disproves every statement, but not both" (which is external two-valuedness) vs. "Theory T proves 'Every proposition is either true or false, but not both' " (internal two-valuedness).

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath You don't need full Zorn's lemma/Choice; you need precisely the ultrafilter lemma. It's exactly the argument that every nontrivial Boolean algebra has some homomorphism into the standard Boolean algebra 2 (aka, an ultrafilter), through which lens it can be quotiented to become 2.

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath But again, just to re-emphasize, doing such an ultrafilter quotient is only necessary for external two-valuedness, and irrelevant to establishing the internal Booleanness of a topos in the first place.

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath Yeah. The whole thing started with discussing "internal logic", and no one should think of two-valuedness as an "internal logic" property, because it's not detectable internally.

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath That is, interpreting formulas of higher-order logic in the internal logic of a topos, in the Kripke-Joyal semantics sense, there is no such formula whose validity in a topos tracks whether that topos is two-valued.

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath [Put another way, in the internal logic, all talk of the externally-valued Hom functor must be replaced with the internal exponential.

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath And in terms of the internal exponential, (1 + 1)^1 = 1 + 1 is a tautology, so every topos is automatically internally two-valued in the Hom(1, 1 + 1) = 1 + 1 sense.

The only substantive internal question is whether the &lt;True, False&gt; map from 1 + 1 to Ω is an isomorphism.]

Text: @sclv @_julesh_ @JadeMasterMath Actually, all this talk I brought up about internal vs. external is sort of a red herring in the context of Set, because Set is, basically by definition, the category for which internal and external concepts all coincide. But I think we're on the same page now about everything.
