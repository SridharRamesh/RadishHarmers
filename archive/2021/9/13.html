It&#39;s not such a win if we analyze the logarithm of your money instead. Indeed, if you always play, after many games, you will have a near 100% probability of having nearly the same money as you started with.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@KingTreeTreTree Relatively few programmers who are using IEEE 754 by unthinking default in their calculations are expecting properties like (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) to fail. Whatever the sense is in which IEEE 754 is &quot;super intuitive&quot;, it is not the relevant one for what I am getting at.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@KingTreeTreTree Properties like a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c do not hold in IEEE 754.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@KingTreeTreTree A paucity of such properties is a paucity of tools with which to reason about one&#39;s code. It is a chore to write, refactor, and maintain code when one is to keep a huge system of complex gotchas most are never even taught in one&#39;s head rather than clean simple rules.</p></blockquote>
