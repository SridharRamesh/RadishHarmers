Text: @HunsuckerJenni Or if you just want answers, I'm game. I always think teachers' philosophy about homework is all wrong. Here are the answers and you can ask for more understanding of whatever you want.

Text: @HunsuckerJenni 9) There's a 12 volt battery sending out 5 amps, so the total resistance is (12 volts) / (5 amps) = 2.4 ohms.

10) Along A1's path, we have our 12 volts running across 3 ohms of resistance, so the current here is (12 volts) / (3 ohms) = 4 amps.

Text: @HunsuckerJenni 11) Our 5 amps total sent 4 amps down A1's path, leaving 5 amps - 4 amps = 1 amp sent down R's path. Given the same 12 volts in play, this means the resistance of R is (12 volts) / (1 amp) = 12 ohms.

Text: @HunsuckerJenni 12) a. Resistance simply adds in series, so the total resistance is 125 ohms + 225 ohms = 350 ohms.

12) b. With 50 volts and 350 ohms, the current is (50 volts) / (350 ohms) = 1/7th of an amp.

Text: @HunsuckerJenni 12) c. With 1/7th of an amp running across 125 ohms, the voltage drop (aka, "potential difference") is 125 ohms * (1/7) amps = 125/7 volts. That is, 17.857… volts.

Text: @HunsuckerJenni 13) a. There's nothing to do here. Just draw what it says, a simple loop of a 12 volt battery and three resistors in a row, of resistance 15 ohms, 21 ohms, and 24 ohms respectively.

Text: @HunsuckerJenni 13) b. Resistance simply adds in series, so the total resistance is 15 ohms + 21 ohms + 24 ohms = 60 ohms.

13) c. With 12 volts running across 60 ohms, the current is (12 volts) / (60 ohms) = 0.2 amps.

Text: @HunsuckerJenni Obviously, the main formula is that voltage drop = current ✕ resistance. This holds at all times in all contexts, both on the overall circuit and on any subcircuit you want to consider. But in addition to that, the key things to keep in mind are:

Text: @HunsuckerJenni * The voltage drop between any two points doesn't depend on the path taken between them

* Every point has the same amount of current in as current out, which is to say, current is the same everywhere along a single path but splits up additively whenever there are multiple paths.

Text: @HunsuckerJenni The voltage drop over the parallel circuit isn't the full 27 volts. Part of the 27 volts drops over the parallel circuit and the rest drops over the 420 ohms resistor.
