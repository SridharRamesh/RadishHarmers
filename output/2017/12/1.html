Text: @Sturgeons_Law Oh, but also, there's a fencepost error in the code, on line 184. That'd explain it.

Text: @shujaxhaider I am alas so online-poisoned I struggle with this once straightforward task. My first thoughts for other things I sincerely find pleasant are spicy pickles, sitting in a chair that's been warmed by another recent occupant, and the color yellow. All true, though.

Text: @sodburger @NoraV3 @megstar73 I don't necessarily disagree w/ your larger point, but I have a big pedantic bone up my ass (er, is that the expression?) about the Shithead, Ledasha spelt Le-a, Oranjello and Lemonjello, etc, family of urban legends. I'm not convinced anyone's ever actually been named Shithead.
