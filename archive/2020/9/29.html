<pre>@NinaTarr @KelgoreTrout There was a flurry of activity after your set, admittedly, but I think the most likely explanation is that this was inspired by the November 2019 campaign for &quot;Jax Sheets | The First Bed Sheets Engineered For Men&quot;, which specifically advertised not needing to be changed. https://t.co/D4KtJBe1VS</pre>

<pre>@ChrisCroy @NickLylesComedy I believe what inspired this timing was the launch in October 2019 of an Internet advertising campaign (and Kickstarter, etc) for &quot;Jax Sheets | The First Bed Sheets Engineered For Men&quot;, which specifically promoted itself as not needing frequent changing. https://t.co/nISbesSp12</pre>

<pre>@NinaTarr @KelgoreTrout I should clarify that the Jax Sheets campaign got into full swing in November, but seems to have started in October, and this likely explains the earliest instance found of the joke in October as well. https://t.co/jed243wjzz</pre>
