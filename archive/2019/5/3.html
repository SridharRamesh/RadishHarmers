<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@cbarrett In my original post, part of the explanation is that x and y are to be functors, so &quot;xG&quot; and &quot;yF&quot; are just ordinary composition. But don&#39;t expect that dummy Terry to get it! He still thinks composition with the identity functor is the same as coproduct with the identity functor!</p></blockquote>

This seems trivially different from having d/dx x^(-n) = -nx^(-n-1) at one&#39;s fingertips, which is presumably what you are contrasting this with.
