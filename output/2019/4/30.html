Your cooked brain may at least allow you to appreciate more of them than the average person. https://t.co/zwp0QjKrC6

Text: @robinhanson Do you think circumstances under which you may only live near your family under pain of enslavement constitute extortion-free legitimate pressure? https://t.co/Mx6kpiTUJL

Text: @robinhanson For Jefferson to offer only such constrained choices (without, say, "Return home a free human being" on the table, as Jefferson could as well grant) is extortion in itself. I seriously question your judgement on all issues relating to liberty if you cannot see this simple truth.

Text: @robinhanson If I restricted myself to legal judgement on all concepts, I would have no grounds to oppose legalized and institutionally entrenched slavery, it's true. You will find the concept of extortion I am referencing in any dictionary, though; an ordinary language definition.

Text: I'm not one of those fools who assumes that just because I live in 2019, therefore 2019 is now. In 1880 they thought 1880 was now, and 1600 in 1600, and so on, all wrong. I've got a feeling we're getting close, though. I bet now lies within the century. And here somewhere nearby.

Text: People are so dumb, killing themselves when depressed. I'd never do that. It makes no sense. I'd wait till my life was going great, never better, then go out on top.  If need be, I'd put in the hard work to improve myself and turn things around, first.

Text: @zzararaii @finger_guns_bi To do shit like... ask what the ingredients in a dish are? I often ask such questions in restaurants, to make sure I don't eat things I wish not to eat. And sometimes, for reassurance, I even ask twice. Why shouldn't other people get to? Why are you so mad?

(Not that vegetarianism is actually the issue at play here; cream is the issue at play)

Text: @zzararaii @finger_guns_bi People DO sometimes interpret words such as "vegan"/"vegetarian"/etc differently. Many times in my life, restaurant dishes called "vegetarian" have contained fish ingredients, which is not how I use the term. So sometimes I ask for clarification. Is it some grave sin to ask?
