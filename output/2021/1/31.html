Text: "My mother said to me, 'If you are a soldier, you will be a general. If you are a monk, you will be Pope'. Instead, I was a painter, and became Picasso." â€”Picasso

That is so me. When I grow up, I don't want to be some general or pope. I burn with originality. I shall be Picasso.

Text: @dan_wickes Thank you. I'm still committed to the project for which I was reducing my posting frequency, so I'm not really back yet. Just one sporadic evening of indulgence.

Text: When I quit drinking, I didn't do it all at once. I just drank less and less frequently, and eventually so rarely, it counted as never again, between each one-off occurrence of again.

Text: @TheRutebega @ElDudrinoWeirdo You are taking it as a grammatical thing about "Uber Eats driver". I did not have that thought but I see now it is the source of the confusion. I was only postulating that the boys ate her, in her role as a deliverer of food.

Text: @niralshah I often see people on our corner of here taking it as a shibboleth associated with bad posts, as with an older fashion of Twitter jokes that dare to have multiple characters speaking in dialogue, but I sincerely think it's fine.

Text: Spotting a poorly designed lottery with a million dollar payout but 0.0005% odds at $2 entry, the mathematician in me springs to action. I liquidate my assets to buy as many tickets as I can. For extra confidence, I buy each with my lucky number.
