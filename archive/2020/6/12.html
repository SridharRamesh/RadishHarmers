<pre>There used to be no point being attracted to people on Twitter, because they all lived somewhere else. You were never going to meet up. Now it&#39;s the same with dating apps in your city. Nothing to do but fuck your roommates, your pets, your roommates&#39; pets, pets&#39; roommates, etc.</pre>

<pre>@ahi_tony It&#39;s an efficient way of facing teams off against each other to yield a complete consistent ranking from best to worst.

<pre>@asmeurer In a typically structured bracket, if you happen to correctly seed, so to speak, the final match-off will be won by the best competitor and lost by the second best competitor. Two more competitors played in the semifinals, but never against each other. Which is the third best?</pre>
