<pre>In the mid-nineties, when not many people had used the Internet, there was a popular joke, &quot;What&#39;s O.J. Simpson&#39;s e-mail address? Slash, backslash, escape&quot;. You couldn&#39;t tell that joke anymore; it wouldn&#39;t work. The moment you hit Esc, it would close the tweet composition window.</pre>

<pre>The first ancient human to near staying awake for 24 hours straight thought it an incredible accomplishment, a Magellan-type feat, till they too were punished for their hubris and murdered by natives. I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again, folks: you can&#39;t trust natives.</pre>

<pre>I bet Terrence Howard would say it should be between Hom(xG, y) and ùêªùëúùëö(ùê∫, ùë•), am I right, folks? What is that nut even thinking? &quot;Uhh 1 x 1 = 2 uhh I re-inflict on women the very physical abuse I suffered as a child uhh Hom(G, x)‚Ä¶&quot;? Fucking roasted. https://t.co/31Qd3HHHpP</pre>

<pre>@cbarrett In my original post, part of the explanation is that x and y are to be functors, so &quot;xG&quot; and &quot;yF&quot; are just ordinary composition. But don&#39;t expect that dummy Terry to get it! He still thinks composition with the identity functor is the same as coproduct with the identity functor!</pre>

<pre>Till then, I&#39;ve got to hide my intentions subtly, but I&#39;m still wearing my baseball cap backwards; a little shibboleth for those &quot;in the know&quot;. Playing it cool while playing it cool. Haha, look, I&#39;m wearing the hat in plain sight, yet this insurance rep doesn&#39;t suspect a thing.</pre>

<pre>For God&#39;s sake, everyone, please stick to dating within your league. There are clear, physically defined leagues. If you have to ask which league you&#39;re in‚Ä¶ Buddy, it&#39;s bad.

<pre>@georgiamarxist Er, what? This seems trivially different from having d/dx x^(-n) = -nx^(-n-1) at one&#39;s fingertips, which is presumably what you are contrasting this with. Are there really people who have the one but not the other in their easy-to-access mathematical toolbox?</pre>

<pre>Still excited by cookies? You child. You philistine. Me, I&#39;m beyond that cookie-cutter shit. I eat only bespoke foods. I eat only grains of rice with my name handwritten on them, and to avoid any possibility of mass manufacture, I legally change my name unpredictably each day.</pre>

<pre>Anytime I tweet a joke that only makes sense to the extremely online, I am disgusted. What a waste of mental energy. I could&#39;ve been bonding with family, cooking meals for the indigent, learning to play piano. This very post is in similar territory. I&#39;m shaking, covered in sweat.</pre>
