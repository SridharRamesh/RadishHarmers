<pre>Liquidating my assets and investing everything into calendar years. I&#39;ve been studying the market, applying my mathematical expertise to search for its hidden statistical patterns, and I&#39;ve discovered those things just keep rocketing up, baby.</pre>

<pre>I before E. A sadly accurate histogram. I&#39;ve reached such high levels of navelgazing narcissism, the most common letter in my tweets is I.</pre>

<pre>You want to express hateful disagreement with this country and the beautiful flag which symbolizes it? You want to foment that kind of anger and aggressive energy? Don&#39;t burn the flag. Wave a Red Bull in front of it. Flags hate that shit; they go nuts.</pre>

<pre>SNL immediately backing down on mildly ribbing a national-level politician/Republican ghoul who wears an eyepatch (who thought he could be a national-level politician who wears an eyepatch and yet escape mild ribbing?), says it all. Spineless to levels Manson could only dream of.</pre>

<pre>Not sure if I&#39;m coming down sick or if it&#39;s just winter drying and chapping every last bit of me? The former would be better as more temporary, while the latter would be better as meaning things aren&#39;t just starting up, ramping into worse. Regardless, I inform my loyal followers.</pre>

<pre>Thank God O&#39;Rourke lost. It pains me to have to discuss this publicly, but (though he appears all sweet and nerdy on the outside) many years ago he held me down and MADE me cum until my calves cramped. It was awful and scarring and the man belongs in prison, not in Congress.</pre>

<pre>I am horrified (and yet, in a terrible way, comforted; oh God, does that make me a bad person?...) to learn that I was not his only victim. We are not alone. https://t.co/ML6ywLcwxr https://t.co/IPo9iRDwyI</pre>
