<pre>Way more nervous about the non-technical stages of job interviews. I don&#39;t want to have to tell you my feelings and motivations and shit. I don&#39;t even tell my family that. I barely allow myself to comprehend them.</pre>

<pre>There&#39;s nothing wrong with putting raisins in food, even if it&#39;s non-traditional, though you&#39;d be surprised by how many cultures do in fact actually occasionally put raisins in food.</pre>

<pre>Re all food arguments: Different people like different foods, the most basic fact about food to which we are all exposed in early childhood. It is why not all restaurants are prix fixe. Hell, it is why multiple restaurants exist.</pre>

<pre>Musk wasn&#39;t saying (((the press))); that&#39;s something from your own mind you&#39;ve inserted so you can score online &quot;Oh no he didn&#39;t!!&quot; points. He&#39;s clearly saying media institutions are owned by powerful people who live in a bubble, a thing lefties on here say with lament every day. https://t.co/XgqboF8PIc</pre>

<pre>@brocialistmeme I&#39;m all for how Twitter reveals how gloriously dumb and unexceptional all the people at the top of the meritocracy heap are; Musk and the like. I just wish it didn&#39;t also keep revealing how dumb the rest of us are as well.</pre>
