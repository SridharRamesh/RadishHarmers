Text: You want to express hateful disagreement with this country and the beautiful flag which symbolizes it? You want to foment that kind of anger and aggressive energy? Don't burn the flag. Wave a Red Bull in front of it. Flags hate that shit; they go nuts.

Text: Not sure if I'm coming down sick or if it's just winter drying and chapping every last bit of me? The former would be better as more temporary, while the latter would be better as meaning things aren't just starting up, ramping into worse. Regardless, I inform my loyal followers.

Text: RT @RadishHarmers: How do I spend my time? I do not make a fuss. I sit quietly and I stare at the wall. Hours later, to keep boredom at bay…

Text: @haramgirlfriend @ByYourLogic @Sturgeons_Law Oh, wow, this may all be too much validation at once. (It definitely is not; others should keep this thread going, an eternal chain). Thanks!
