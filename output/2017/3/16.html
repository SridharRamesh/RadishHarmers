Text: It's a little weird that it's always "Bernie" and never just "Sanders". Is there a good explanation of this linguistic phenomenon?

Text: Seems politicians are generally last-namers: "Obama", "Trump", etc. "Hillary" and "Clinton" both get play, former perhaps as disambiguator.

Text: @TibiusReynolds I suppose it's also likely that Bernie paints himself as Bernie, to seem folksy or something.

Text: @faceplant10 Still, I don't sense that "Barack" gets the same treatment, which is perhaps that marketing difference vs. "Bernie", "Hillary".

Text: @jcreed @tausbn @increpare @edsaperia Ah, ok, it's f(f(f(x))) = f(x)^2 - f(x) + 1 plus the starting observations f^2 0 = f^2 1 = 1.

Text: @jcreed @tausbn @increpare @edsaperia 1 is unique fixed point of g, so f 1 = 1. Next f^3 0 = 1 = g f 0, so f 0 in g^{-1}(1) = {0, 1}, etc.
