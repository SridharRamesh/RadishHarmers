<pre>Why would the kids in my life care about the revival of some dumb shows I used to watch when I was a kid? It&#39;s all the same to them. I hope my kids someday get to experience fresh ideas instead of just their parents&#39; endless hidebound nostalgia. https://t.co/mqic4Ye1EA</pre>

<pre>The parent excited to introduce their child to All That, fondly recalling such favorite wacky quips from Lori Beth&#39;s Vital Information as &quot;If you&#39;re drinking apple juice and it feels warm, odds are, that ain&#39;t apple juice!&quot;, is a figure more wretched than even any SNL fan.</pre>

<pre>Number Theory 101. The whole course was just about the properties of 101; how it is prime, equals 1! - 2! + 3! - 4! + 5!, and so on. I can&#39;t complain too much; I got an amazing grade on the final.

<pre>Gaming? Listen, I know gaming. I was a big gamer in high school. Huge. Everyone recognized my prowess. As I walked the halls, they&#39;d yell out &quot;Here comes Game-mesh! Get a load of the Game Man, everybody!&quot;, as well as some constructions that didn&#39;t make grammatical sense or parse.</pre>

<pre>The Holocaust war, the slavery war, and the stars and stripes war. The &quot;Oh, war is bad, but THOSE 3 were good&quot; wars. The inverse rap-and-country of wars.</pre>

<pre>My dad isn&#39;t particularly radical in his politics, indeed he holds lots of views I&#39;d consider wrongheadedly centrist in the ways typical of his generation and stratum as I see it, but he did get that moment right.</pre>

<pre>Woke up with that on-the-verge-of-coming-down-ill feeling in my throat, hoping it was a fluke. As the day goes on, the odds of a fluke dim, but I&#39;m still crossing my fingers. I think I got a flu shot last fall, so it&#39;d be impossible to get sick now, right?</pre>

<pre>@kathbarbadoro If you can fill the entire board with letters, forming words along the entirety of each column and of each row, this is allowed. This is referred to as &quot;shooting the moon&quot; and only becomes available in rare cases when the board has at most 7 squares remaining, or when cheating.</pre>
