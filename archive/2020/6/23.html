<pre>As usual, on both this and the 30 Rock episodes taken down [by Tina Fey&#39;s own request, to be fair], I disagree with making our taboos the mechanical superficial rubric, rather than considering what a joke (or whatever) is actually saying. https://t.co/X8CbJLxi7a</pre>

<pre>One might also say these jokes, even if not unethical per se, just aren&#39;t funny. That comics have gone to this well too often. That&#39;s de gustibus,  and for me a case-by-case judgement. But regardless, the &quot;Do not portray!&quot; taboo is clearly asserting more than mere comedic flab.</pre>

<pre>I realize lots of people always say this. Yeah, lots of people say it because it&#39;s correct.

I also realize that this discourse is perfectly well covered by other people, comes up all the time, is tedious, and will not be changed by my adding to it.</pre>

<pre>@reezels In our particular discourse bubbles. As with many such things, it&#39;s hard to know exactly what opinions are like in the populace in large.

Lots of old comics complain about this sort of thing boringly on stage all the time, I&#39;ve noticed. Often largely in the right, but boringly.</pre>

<pre>My irking about this is also far from the most important thing to irk about. Most important is systemic racist oppression in 1000 material ways, police brutality, etc, of course. But I still irk about this sometimes. Yes, partly selfishly because I fear getting ensnared in it.</pre>

<pre>Now, the objection to the David Cross sketch could be raised that it&#39;s a bit copaganda: the driver is annoying and we&#39;re to sympathize with the cops brutalizing him. Sure. I&#39;d agree with that critique. Not to an extent that I think this silly sketch ought be taken down, though.</pre>

<pre>Remembering high school, when my best friend had recently heard NIN&#39;s Closer and described it to me as &quot;Trent Reznor being shockingly overtly gay. I didn&#39;t know he was gay&quot;, with emphasis on lines like &quot;I want to feel you from the inside&quot;, which he saw as &quot;super homoerotic&quot;.</pre>

<pre>Clearly comedians have gone to this well so often. As I said, it has perhaps been run rather dry comedically. But I don&#39;t see reason to memory-hole it all, as though ethically unconscionable. I also don&#39;t think all the things being categorized as blackface are quite the same.</pre>

<pre>@Discourse_Stu Another irk this touches upon is copyright. If it was easier to just have a convenient store of everything ever made, then I wouldn&#39;t care what Netflix, etc, kept curated to maintain their image as unassailably good. But then, they wouldn&#39;t have a reason to exist either.</pre>
