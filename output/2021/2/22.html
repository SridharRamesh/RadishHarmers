Text: This weekend must honestly be assessed as a failure. But each failure is a lesson setting up the next success, blah blah such platitudes. I say these platitudes not as jokes. I'm going to figure out how to make myself actually finish this thing, while still enjoying other things.

Text: I come to. What is going on? I cannot see anything. The doctor informs me it was a very bad accident. I have been blinded and may never walk again. "How horrible!", I cry. The doctor and my family, all mouth agape with shock, chide me for my rank ableism.

Text: @neoliberal_dad @len0killer If you mean to make the jargon pun, and I suspect you do, I must note that normal numbers aren't of any interest arithmetically, only qua digit-sequences. No one's ever shown any quantity of natural arithmetic interest to be normal. But this thread is only for jokes.
