Text: @Braingetter Comedy is about truth, either of the "Racism is bad" or "Cancel culture is bad" variety, depending on comic's age. By standardizing the list of truths to perform, we reduce the barriers to entry and increase the diversity of the field.

Text: "It would be logically impossible for me to kill you, but there is no difficulty in you killing me. Let us end this hellish cycle. Though the task strikes you with dread, dread I remember well, you can and will push through to do what needs be done, as I did when I was your age." https://t.co/K0BPeeK5VP

Text: The first two seasons up to but ignoring the very last moment of season two (the new character that's out of place) were great.

Some of the stuff from season 3 still fits that dynamic (Katharina's fate, say), but the rest, meh. Let the ground rules stay as they were.

Text: The Dark finale did exactly what I hoped it wouldn't do, what I feared, spoiling what had been so great about it. The pull of familiar narrative is too much to resist. Oh well.

Text: My notifications are buggy. God is giving me a sign, but what is He trying to say? If other people's notifications are buggy too, it means the message for me is so important, God is sending it on every channel.
