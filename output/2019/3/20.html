Text: Why would the kids in my life care about the revival of some dumb shows I used to watch when I was a kid? It's all the same to them. I hope my kids someday get to experience fresh ideas instead of just their parents' endless hidebound nostalgia. https://t.co/mqic4Ye1EA

Text: The parent excited to introduce their child to All That, fondly recalling such favorite wacky quips from Lori Beth's Vital Information as "If you're drinking apple juice and it feels warm, odds are, that ain't apple juice!", is a figure more wretched than even any SNL fan.

Text: Number Theory 101. The whole course was just about the properties of 101; how it is prime, equals 1! - 2! + 3! - 4! + 5!, and so on. I can't complain too much; I got an amazing grade on the final.

Text: Gaming? Listen, I know gaming. I was a big gamer in high school. Huge. Everyone recognized my prowess. As I walked the halls, they'd yell out "Here comes Game-mesh! Get a load of the Game Man, everybody!", as well as some constructions that didn't make grammatical sense or parse.

Text: The Holocaust war, the slavery war, and the stars and stripes war. The "Oh, war is bad, but THOSE 3 were good" wars. The inverse rap-and-country of wars.

Text: My dad isn't particularly radical in his politics, indeed he holds lots of views I'd consider wrongheadedly centrist in the ways typical of his generation and stratum as I see it, but he did get that moment right.

Text: Woke up with that on-the-verge-of-coming-down-ill feeling in my throat, hoping it was a fluke. As the day goes on, the odds of a fluke dim, but I'm still crossing my fingers. I think I got a flu shot last fall, so it'd be impossible to get sick now, right?

Text: @BUSSCRO Fuck, I would so dearly like to Like this tweet, but I just cannot reconcile "spindle-thin" and "morbid obesity". Out of integrity, I must abstain.

Text: @kathbarbadoro If you can fill the entire board with letters, forming words along the entirety of each column and of each row, this is allowed. This is referred to as "shooting the moon" and only becomes available in rare cases when the board has at most 7 squares remaining, or when cheating.
