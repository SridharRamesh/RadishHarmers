Text: Much like a pet or small child, I'm exceedingly bad at doing things and my attempts are loose imitations of a competent adult. But unlike a pet or small child, no one adores me for it or coos over my efforts. I don't get it. (My comprehension abilities are at the level of a pet o

Text: Ah, it's too late to reword now, but for the record, I think the better quip would've been "Aw, that's too bad. Don't beat yourself up over it, though; just go out there and try again with 110 hours."

Alas. I'll be beating myself up over this‚Ä¶

Text: @qDot I'm having a hard time understanding the sequel to the first 80 tweet thread; could you explain it via analogy to the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, perhaps? I want to agree with you that the robot pictured above won't give great blowjobs, but I don't want to rush to judgement. https://t.co/hgUmKrL5UW

Text: I'm not living my best life, but I will, as soon as I get the signal (the form of which, unfortunately, I haven't been pre-instructed as to; still, I'll recognize it when at hand). Trust me: I'm alert and ready and even eager; just dutifully waiting on Control.

Text: @Styl_oh The Simpsons suffers from SNL disease (so much accumulated prestige that they can never call it quits, but will never really do anything notable anymore either), without even the benefit of occasional acute topicality to trick you into tuning in.

Text: @Anarchangel_ @waynejacker @TurdyMcFergy @AngloAntiracist Seems like this would just result in the ambulances getting even more tied up attending to new casualties requiring urgent care. I'm not sure you've thought this through as carefully as I originally assumed from your typing the words "very realistic".
