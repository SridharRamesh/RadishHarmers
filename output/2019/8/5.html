Text: My TO DO list is one of those gotcha assignments that starts with "Read all instructions carefully before starting" and then towards the end says "By the way, don't do any of these. If you do, you fail. Don't believe the other instructions' lies. I'm the one to trust".

Text: @RadioSqrl @MADdelaRosa @isaiah_kb People shouldn't have to move to have lives with dignity, and lives need to be improved all over, to where there isn't significant global inequity.
