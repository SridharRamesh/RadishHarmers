Text: @sigfpe Oh, maybe I misinterpreted what you meant. But by "left", I mean remaining. No further moves remaining. You can reduce any configuration in many ways, but the final configuration you end up at is independent of your choices, by suitable confluence.

Text: @sigfpe Right, I was saying the confluence is the non-obvious part, but I wouldn't associate that with the associativity, as such.

For what it's worth, here's the three-tweet proof of confluence I have in mind:

Text: @sigfpe A) Say relation → is "confluent against" ↓ if, given a→b and a↓c, ∃d with b↓d and c→d (ie, given the top and left of a square, you can fill out the rest).

Claim: If → is confluent against ↓, then →* is confluent against ↓*, where * denotes reflexive transitive closure

Text: @sigfpe B) Say → is "near-confluent against" ↓ if the above confluence property is only demanded when b and c are distinct.

Claim: If → is near-confluent against ↓, then →+ is confluent against ↓+, where + denotes reflexive closure.

Proof: Easy examination of cases.

Text: @sigfpe C) Let aRb mean sandpile b is available from sandpile a by toppling a single eligible location.

Claim: R is near-confluent against itself.

Text: @sigfpe Proof: Whenever one has two distinct toppling locations available, either one remains available after toppling the other, and toppling the two successively in either order brings one to the same resulting state.

Text: @sigfpe Conclusion from (A) + (B) + (C): R* is confluent against itself.

Corollary: There is at most one stable sandpile reachable from a given sandpile.

Text: Fuck, I think I need to give up Spotify and go back to managing music locally. Incredibly frustrating I can't search my playlists, the most basic feature of a music organizer. Why does no software let anybody do anything anymore? Why is everyone so terrified of the "power user"?

Text: Colleges shouldn't have selective admissions. Quit wasting time debating each other over the exact ranking of who does and doesn't deserve to go to which bastion of old prestige, who deserves a Harvard life and who has to settle for some State U. Kill the meritocrat in your head.

Text: @matthewaraven @nachdermas We shouldn't be taking it as such a given that just some fixed cap of people deserve good lives and others less so and a merit-based sorting hat will determine who's who at 18. I realize I'm the Harrison Bergeron boogyman when I say things like this, but whatever.

Text: @matthewaraven @nachdermas The only reason Harvard even has so many applicants is because of its association with entry into wealth. If it was just about keen paleontology students learning insights from the country's top paleontologists, and whatnot, the scrutiny would just be "Attend this year or next?".
