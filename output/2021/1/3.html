Text: The Times Square ball drop started as a way for its owner, the New York Times, to synchronize the year's news. All the events they planned to have occur in the year, in finely calibrated sequence across the world, would be initiated by the ball triggering a switch at the bottom.

Text: @noahdmancino @tequehead This makes up a definition of "strongly coherent doxastic states", with which I would quibble (Why assign scores as an affine function of the mere cardinalities of right and of wrong beliefs? It's just made up. One could assign scores in other ways), but even putting that aside,

Text: @noahdmancino @tequehead the only conclusion it draws about probability is that using a probability distribution and a probability threshold is one sufficient condition for arriving at a strongly coherent doxastic state. But there are plenty of strongly coherent doxastic states that are not of this form.

Text: @noahdmancino @tequehead Kenny notes as much in section 5.1. He still suggests that using probability distributions to generate doxastic states in this way "may be the simplest and most general way to guarantee that one’s doxastic state is strongly coherent, and so agents have some prima facie reason to

Text: @noahdmancino @tequehead have a doxastic state that is represented by a probability function, even though Strong Coherence only requires that they have some doxastic state that is strongly coherent." But there are far simpler ways to do so.

Text: @Viscous_cree @haircut_hippie You've quoted the joke about Jews controlling show business twice. Well, yes, this is a play on a common trope, that Jews (and gay people, in this case) control show business. His joke is that this trope is absurd, that such literal control center command would be absurd.

Text: @snelsonmandela2 Saying the word is not the same as calling someone the word. It's a silly taboo where one can't even say the name of the word to discuss the word. There is no need to consider this a great moral outrage or as proof that he harbors racial animus.
