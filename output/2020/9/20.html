Text: @jlindy77 This is the only joke correction I will accept of the many joke corrections I have received all day. Please choose an amount of time on the outgoing leg, amount of time ingoing, and sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) for the ingoing leg to achieve a cumulative dilation factor you find sufficient.

Text: @emoprog There are many questions one can ask about the coin flips but for example, perhaps you are interested in the mean number of flips until achieving 8 heads in a row for the first time.

Text: @emoprog Let f(n) be the mean number of flips until achieving n heads in a row. f(0) is clearly 0. In order to get n + 1 many heads in a row, you must first get n many heads in a row. Then you must make one more flip, which has 50-50 odds of success or of making you restart from scratch.

Text: @emoprog So f(n + 1) = f(n) + 1 + 0.5 * f(n + 1). This tells us f(n + 1) = 2f(n) + 2. We can quickly calculate f(8) from this, which is 510.

We can even solve this recurrence relation into a closed form, to determine f(n) = 2^(n + 1) - 2 in general.

Text: @emoprog An interesting further question to consider is, what about other patterns? For example, how many flips on average would it take to get a head followed by seven tails? The answer often surprises people.
