<pre>When people or things are described as S-Tier, it&#39;s because they&#39;re equally as good as me. They tie with me. I myself am S-Tier as well.</pre>

<pre>When a nonagenarian bucks 99% of their cohort to vote lefter in every primary than your parents or any elder you&#39;ve ever loved, then votes lesser evil in the general (no shitfit on your FB or anything, just answering when asked), they&#39;re cancelled. Not good enough. Get wrecked.</pre>

<pre>I disagree with each human on at least one issue, including past and future me. It is a relief on occasion to be able to bend without breaking, particularly when the bend demands no change in action from me, just countenancing someone else&#39;s variant opinion existing in the world.</pre>

<pre>Men are like this. Women are like this. Ladies need to do this. Fellas mustn&#39;t do this. Dudes rock. Men are the worst. Mars. Venus. Perhaps I&#39;ve made poor choices in who to follow, but I fear there&#39;s no escape regardless. People eat this shit up even after millennia of the genre.</pre>

<pre>It is irksome how every little thing becomes fodder for some battle of the sexes bullshit on this site. Why is everyone so keen to be an ancient standup hack? I will not name examples; I can retweet this on any given day and you can scroll up and down to find five fresh ones.</pre>

<pre>@delmoi Of course that&#39;s what it is, and I am yelling at the sea. But as far as I&#39;m concerned, sure, maybe it&#39;s fresh when you&#39;re 16 if you haven&#39;t been paying attention your whole childhood. But by the time you&#39;re in your twenties, it can hardly be fresh to anyone not living in a cave.</pre>

<pre>I only ever get anything done by announcing convoluted but concrete rules. Till I&#39;m 35, after any day I post, I shall not post again till I&#39;ve written a page of math, or a page of sketch or other real comedy. A page is nothing, I&#39;ve written many pages before, should be easy.</pre>
