<pre>More generally, this shows that there is no &amp;lt;-preserving map from the powerset of X to X, where X is any partially ordered set and its powerset is ordered by inclusion. As there is such a map from the powerset of ℕ to ℝ, we find that ℕ and ℝ are not isomorphic as sets.</pre>

<pre>@donorsHATEhim There&#39;s no presumption here that this sequence will contain all the reals. It&#39;s just that, if you construct the transfinite sequence in this particular way from a map from naturals to reals, the sequence must eventually come to an end at an element not in the range of the map.</pre>

<pre>@donorsHATEhim This sequence will definitely not contain all the reals, since there will be lots of reals left out between any two consecutive values within it. That&#39;s ok, there&#39;s no presumption here that this sequence will contain all the reals or all the reals in the range of our map even.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@donorsHATEhim The important thing is that the sequence can always be further extended, unless it hits a value not in the range of our map. So when we extend the sequence as long as possible, it must eventually hit a value not in the range of our map.</pre>

<pre>@artlesscommerce Consider all the possible sequences of this sort. We can take their union [viewed as subsets of the reals], to get the longest possible sequence of this sort. Since it&#39;s the longest possible, it can&#39;t be extended any further.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@marx_knopfler On the other hand, this argument is directly about the reals qua continuum, while diagonalization is really about 2^N or such things. In intuitionistic(/constructive) math, 2^N is not the same as the real continuum.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@marx_knopfler There are intuitionistic contexts where 2^N is the surjective image of some subset of the naturals (e.g., this happens in the effective topos, where sending naturals coding total computable functions to the total computable functions they encode hits all of 2^N).</pre>

<p>
<pre>@marx_knopfler In these contexts, one has many different definitions of the reals available (they come apart intuitionistically), but I believe this argument would still make, e.g., the Dedekind-MacNeille reals unsurjectable by subsets of naturals. I haven&#39;t fully thought this through, though.</pre>

<pre>@artlesscommerce It&#39;s not circular (although it is what is technically called &quot;impredicative&quot;). We don&#39;t need to know that every such sequence terminates. We just need to know that the set of such sequences is closed under unions.</pre>

<pre>@artlesscommerce If we then take the union of ALL such sequences, we get a sequence which is, by construction, as long as any such sequence. That is, it is the longest such sequence.

Since it is the longest, it cannot be extended.</pre>

But with the &quot;strong induction&quot; framing, no special base case is ever needed. Everything is handled uniformly.</pre>
