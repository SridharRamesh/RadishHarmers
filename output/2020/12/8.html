Text: @SimonCharlow The relevant trait of implication is A &amp; B ⊢ C iff A ⊢ B ⊃ C, not this sort of thing. Things ought be approached directly via the properties one actually cares about, not some other opaque monstrosity that merely happens to allow eventual re-derivation of what one cares about.

Text: @jackeselbst Instantiations of this statement (with whatever formulas in place of the variables) plus modus ponens are enough to get every tautology of Boolean propositional logic phrased using only implication.

Text: @jackeselbst That does not mention you get every statement of Boolean propositional logic, because, as you note, you can't define every Boolean operator simply from Boolean implication.

Text: @jackeselbst If you want to get all of classical logic, then add to this some other operators and axiomatize them. You can do it a million ways. But I find it very unclarifying to try and do all this in a minimal way. It serves no purpose, it's just a kind of butterfly-collecting.

Text: @jackeselbst Just axiomatize everything directly in terms of the properties directly relevant.

For Boolean logic, even "axiomatization" as such is a bit unnecessary. You can just say truth tables define operators and their tautologies and be done with it. That's as good a rule as any other.

Text: @jackeselbst It's neatest to play around with when you can see it clearly, is my perspective, and all this minimal axiomatization stuff only obfuscates rather than clarifies the properties of the logic. But if you want to gaze upon some minimal thing, for whatever sense of minimal, feel free.

Text: @jackeselbst Huh, that "mention" was supposed to be "mean", but it sort of works out anyway.

Text: @jackeselbst If you really want only one operator, implication won't do, but you can take NAND or NOR as you know. Even this isn't really correct, is my opinion, because you can't build a 0-ary operator out of those, and 0-ary operators exist, much as folks like to ignore them.

Text: @jackeselbst If you want a minimalish setup that still illuminates Boolean logic in a non-obfuscatory way, then you can give yourself the 0-ary operators True and False and the 3-ary operator if-then-else, which is naturally axiomatized and other operators are naturally built from it.
