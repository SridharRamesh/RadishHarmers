Text: I was too cowardly for the rib surgery, so instead, I've acquired a voodoo doll of myself and will be just going to town on it. What a careless misstep of my nemesis to have this made, leaving him one unwatchful moment from granting me ultimate forbidden pleasure.

Text: Hell yeah I can code. It's easy; according to Shannon's groundbreaking 1948 "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", it can be done optimally (or as near optimally as desired) with high probability by just making choices at random.

Text: Hey, quick question, maybe I should have asked this earlier, but, how do you take selfies? What system of lenses and pulleys allows the one and same entity to be both agent and patient, in defiance of God's law?

Text: Ah, now (October 14, 2018, a date which will live in infamy), we'll soon hear the truth. "I never said it was ten inches, I said his babymaker was smack dab in the middle of 9/11".

Text: @shitshowdotinfo I hope someday you no longer have to settle for coy, indirect self-promo and fully embrace the possibilities of doing it for yourself. Oh, what's this? Who left this here? https://t.co/YrQ6zICRXz

Text: @Sturgeons_Law Ah, immortal enemy of Indian skin cream, Fair and Lawly. (This is a joke whose only plausible audience has already heard me say it.)

Text: Videogames unduly raised my expectations for the efficacy of medicine (typically found in scattered Red Cross boxes). Adulthood has been a long frustrating letdown, in this respect. Murdering ducks has also turned out to provide less playful cheer than I'd been trained for.

Text: Breaking up is always hard, but extricating myself from this polycule has been especially so. Each time I'm almost free, someone points out I forgot to say "UNO", and I'm right back in again. Fucking and sucking and shaking my fist in rage, swearing I'll remember THIS time.

Text: @dannyburt33 @avinashsrajput That part was fine. It was when you started sobbing afterwards, saying "Here we go! HERE WE GO!" through tears, that I felt a line was crossed.

Text: An undeniable statistical fact is that a much larger percentage of my friends hate me than of just random people in the world. My therapist could not credibly dispute this basic numeric phenomenon, but just suggests I not dwell on it.

Text: Going back in time to warn the residents of New York as 2001 approaches that next year, the third millennium will begin, actually, technically, since the BC to AD switch-off lacked a year zero, you see, so it didn't start yet in 2000 like you think, you've been getting it all wro

Text: The hot woman with the pic of herself and the quote-tweet ready vapid prompt who everyone's dunking on for just wanting attention… I will not dunk on her. I too just want attention. We are kindred spirits. We share a rare bond. Oh, wow, maybe she'd want to date me? I should DM h

Text: DNA tests analyzed by a top geneticist confirm, to my surprise, what family lore had claimed. With high confidence, within the most recent 6 to 10 generations, I have an Indian in my ancestry. I am excited to discover my heritage and to begin researching more about him or her.
