<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@radical_ideals @yungneocon For what it&#39;s worth, though it&#39;s of course wonderful to understand the full math of sphere volumes, if one just wants to understand why the inner-sphere-to-outer-box volume ratio approaches zero for large dimensions, the explanation in that Wikipedia article is overkill.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@radical_ideals @yungneocon The volume-ratio for any figure to its enclosing box is upper-bounded by the corresponding ratio for any cross-section of it. Indeed, it&#39;s upper-bounded by the product of the corresponding ratios for cross-sections which live in separate orthogonal dimensions.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@radical_ideals @yungneocon E.g., the volume of the Earth has to be less than than the length of the polar axis times the area of the perpendicular equatorial disk, since the Earth fits into the cylinder of all points which project onto those same cross-sections.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@radical_ideals @yungneocon But every cross-section of a high-dimensional sphere is just some lower-dimensional sphere. In this way, we see that if f(n) is the n-dimensional unit sphere volume, f(a + b) ≤ f(a) f(b). [Our argument about the Earth was the special case of this for f(1 + 2) ≤ f(1) f(2)].</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@radical_ideals @yungneocon Among other things, this tells us that f(2n) ≤ f(2)^n. And since f(2) &amp;lt; 1, we see that f shrinks at least exponentially fast towards zero.<br><br>FIN.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon Without loss of generality, we can restrict our attention to points with positive coordinates, as all the ratios will be the same here as in any other &quot;quadrant&quot;; thus, we skip all the 2^n business.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon But by the law of large numbers, as n gets large, nearly 100% of the volume is contained at points whose coordinates average to about 1/2, which is larger than 1/sqrt(n). Thus, asymptotically 100% of the &quot;quadrant&quot; is on the other side of the tangent plane from the sphere. QED.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon Basically, what&#39;s happening here is that, contra low-dimensional intuition, in larger dimensions, the center of each &quot;quadrant&quot; is itself already outside the sphere. Its coordinates are all 1/2, so it has distance sqrt(n)/2 from the origin, which exceeds 1 once n exceeds 4.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon Given N independent values uniformly between -1 and 1, in the large N limit, almost certainly, the mean of their absolute values is within epsilon of 1/2. But their root mean square has to be at least as large as this mean (squaring is a &quot;convex&quot; function).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon So almost certainly their root mean square is nearly 1/2. But to count as &quot;in the sphere&quot;, the sum of their squares has to be under 1, which means their mean square has to be under 1/n, which means their root mean square has to be under 1/sqrt(n). As 1/2 exceeds 1/sqrt(n), QED.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@rahuldphys @radical_ideals @yungneocon Also, actually, the mean vs. root mean square inequality is overkill here. We know very specifically the distribution of each coordinates&#39; square, which has a mean value of 1/3. So almost certainly the mean of these squares is very nearly 1/3, which exceeds the sphere limit 1/n.</p></blockquote>
