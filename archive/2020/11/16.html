<pre>@Seamus_Malek While there is a lower class, I am in it, while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free. That said, I would enjoy a strawberry-banana milkshake.</pre>

<pre>@haikugoat Yes, I am just noting that my scorched Earth bitterness extends to bitterness at all levels of everything. Math culture has some rot even higher up. Few things are ever taught or thought as well as they should be, even among experts. Lots of mindless ritual repetition even there.</pre>

<pre>I&#39;m not the first to say this obvious point, but it does seem not that many say it, even among those who want to cancel student debt. At every level, some mass of people are hesitant to support pushing for more. Possibility has been beaten out of us.</pre>

<pre>It&#39;s not false that it&#39;s unfair to only refund student debt for those who didn&#39;t pay theirs off already. But the answer is, the better thing to do is refund full tuition to everyone who paid it. If that&#39;s the alternative being proposed, great.</pre>

<pre>@jackeselbst What a pleasant unexpected surprise! Thank you. For what it&#39;s worth, I was tickled by the machine that turns off its own buttons which you recently shared as metaphor for co-editing collaboration. I hope the manuscript you and Christa were writing came out well. All the best!</pre>

<pre>@frankieg_baby Thank you, Frankie. I miss our Endgames days, our little San Francisco comedy small pond, but I&#39;m happy you took the plunge to go to LA. I hope things are taking off there, although I know corona makes things hard everywhere now (I&#39;ve not done nearly enough in NY as I hoped yet).</pre>
