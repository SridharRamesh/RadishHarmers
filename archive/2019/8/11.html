<pre>@BreakTheHuddle No. I have a right to say what I like and I will not stand for anyone trying to suppress my views. We need to make sure irresponsible speculation and illegitimate influence do not gain an audience and fester.</pre>

<pre>My sincere opinions:

Someone repeats a joke multiple others have made before: Ugh. C&#39;mon. Do better. We must strive for originality, or what&#39;s the point?

Someone repeats a joke they alone have made before: Haha. A classic. Glad to see it again; glad it&#39;s getting new exposure.</pre>

<pre>Wracking my head desperately for a non-self-serving position, in order to prove I am a man of principle. Aha! I&#39;ve got it! My wish and plot for my enemies to suffer marks me a true altruist. For is not holding onto anger like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die?</pre>
