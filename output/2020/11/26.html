Text: They should make a videogame where you can hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, and criticize after dinner, just as you have a mind. I'd play it in my free time after work.

Text: Stop citing Benford's law. Benford's law is bullshit. There's no reason to expect general empirical data to have a distribution which is log-uniform modulo an arbitrary log(10).

Text: It's utterly maddening every time people cite Benford's law as evidence of, e.g., election irregularities. If you see election results that satisfy Benford's law, you're dealing with fraud perpetuated by people who've read too much about Benford's law.

Text: @sock_dem It's good that he distanced himself from this particular instance, but this is also the foremost guy pushing the theory that Benford's law analysis of second digits can be used to detect election fraud in general. Which I find quite misguided, clearly.

Text: @puledipuledi There's no particular reason to expect general empirical data to be log-uniform at all. The same people who say this stuff also go around saying everything is normally distributed at other times, or everything is uniform. These are all very different distributions.

Text: @puledipuledi Some "law". It's no law, it's a kind of distribution, that some things sometimes come close to if you squint your eyes, like seeing the golden ratio everywhere. There's no reason to expect general empirical data to be log-uniform rather than any other distribution.

Text: @puledipuledi It depends on the data. People try to convince themselves there's some simple law they can apply in general, without having to know anything or almost anything about the particular data-generating process. But it doesn't actually work that way.
