<pre>@Hermit_Thrush You may enjoy (if not already aware) the fact that this same property of being one&#39;s own automorphism group holds of S_n for any n other than 2 or 6. (The conjugation map from a group to its automorphism group fails to be injective at n = 2, and fails to be surjective at n = 6.)</pre>

<pre>@TheJesseWu The &quot;map key&quot;, it should be noted, was added last year at https://t.co/qxI4EIS2Fo. The image is not of my creation; only its recontextualization here.</pre>
