<pre>Amazon and eBay both sounds like bodies of water, but I&#39;ve never been able to figure out what to do with this observation. I gift it to posterity. Let it make some 23rd century grad student in History smile as they browse these archives.</pre>

<pre>Can&#39;t remember how to calculate the volume of a cylindrical pizza of radius z and height a? No fear. Simply use Archimedes&#39; principle to displace an equal volume of water, which can then be weighed to yield the answer by proxy, given its known standard density.</pre>

<pre>ME IN 2009: Fuck off, it&#39;ll never be 2017. No way. Willing to bet large sums of money on this.
ME IN 2019, FINANCIALLY RUINED: Ok. Ok. I&#39;ve learnt my lesson. It will be 2017. It&#39;ll definitely be 2017, just you wait. Willing to bet large sums of money on this.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe Monoidal monads are boxes, anyway, in that boxes are the same thing as lax monoidal functors. But granted, any monad on (whatever is being construed as) Set is automatically monoidal/strong, and these are the only things functional programmers go around calling &quot;monads&quot; anyway.</pre>

<pre>At the end of Barry&#39;s first season, I thought it was a wonderful show that could only spin its wheels and tarnish its legacy by pointlessly continuing into a second season. I was wrong. And ronny/lilly makes particularly clear just how wrong I was.</pre>

Why isn&#39;t this working?!
[Indeed, the buttons aren&#39;t connected to anything. Loose wires dangle beneath panel.]
