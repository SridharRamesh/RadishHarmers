Text: Once, a scribe was a learned expert and handsomely paid. Now if by the age of seven you don't possess their entire skillset, you're considered super dumb.

Text: That first time as a child seeing fireworks, it was so exciting. What untold wonders the world had in store for me yet to discover. The next year, when I saw fireworks again, just the same, I understood what a fool I had been, and calibrated my expectations for life accordingly.

Text: Didn't have to work yesterday? Must be a day ending in "nday".

Had to work yesterday and will still have to work tomorrow? Must be a day ending in "sday".

Had to work yesterday but will not have to work tomorrow? Things are really turning around. I'm happy for you.

Text: @spindlypete Yeah, it's a freak rare occurrence for a crossword to be this gimmicky. A special treat for people who play crosswords all the time and are sick of words.

Text: @babarganesh @hahahaohman @FecalMonsoon @ComradeLuanne The show as far as what math is does not rely on memorizing any particular digit strings, though it may naturally happen over time regardless. You shouldn't lie about math and say it cannot be done with a calculator.

Text: @babarganesh @hahahaohman @FecalMonsoon @ComradeLuanne We invented calculators just like we invented decimal notation, in order to use them. They're easier than what came before, so there's no longer such need for what came before. Or ought we drill memorizing multiplication tables in Roman numerals as well?

Text: @babarganesh @hahahaohman @FecalMonsoon @ComradeLuanne Everyone is able to multiply without a machine. Given time, they can write out the multiplication table for themselves. They understand perfectly. They just don't have it memorized for instant recall. Why is such speed important? When speed matters, use a calculator.
