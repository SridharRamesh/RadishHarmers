<pre>When I remember delicious food, the taste comes into my brain. Little loophole in the system. Why bother actually cooking the thing, at that point? Why buy the cow when I get the milk for free? And similarly for memories that aren&#39;t food.</pre>

<pre>If you snatch the bouquet before it&#39;s even thrown, you get to take over the proceedings and get married then and there, to the already prepared groom. The true test of a fiance&#39;s love is how actively he guards the bouquet throughout the ceremony.</pre>

<pre>@luqui @DrKeithRamsay @Quelklef @sigfpe It shows that if RH is not disprovable by the exhibition of a counterexample, then it is true. And thus, if RH is provably not disprovable, then it is provably true. (&quot;Provably&quot; meaning in your favorite proof system, whichever one you like.)</pre>

<pre>@Quelklef @luqui @sigfpe In general, this detail needs to be taken care of for this kind of argument to work, yes. And in this case, it can be taken care of. There are zero-finding algorithms such that, iff there is a nontrivial zeta zero off the critical line, they will eventually report its existence.</pre>
