<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@dlphd2 It&#39;s not some great conspiracy leaking out. Some rando put it there today while also calling him a dictator (see the specific edit: https://t.co/qWJIwvJTjM). Any rando can put anything on Wikipedia; it hardly seems worthy of surprise that sometimes they do.</p></blockquote>

Let this be a lesson to everyone to switch to zero-indexing.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@negrosubversive Oh, you can have whatever standards you have. It&#39;s all case-by-case and subjective. But my own attitude is pretty forgiving of, say, rando nobodies who made dumb jokes five years ago. I&#39;m happy to say they were dumb, but I don&#39;t care to lord it over them as forever irredeemable.</p></blockquote>

And if they&#39;re dumb now but not actually wielding power heinously, they&#39;re dumb but otherwise fine, maybe even good. Etc. I feel like these distinctions sometimes get collapsed here. People can just be a bit dumb, it&#39;s fine.</p></blockquote>
