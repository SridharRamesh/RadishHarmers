Text: Yes, yes, it's a big mug labeled "Sridhar Tears", but if you examine the back, you'll see it continues "It Up On The Dance Floor And In The Bedroom". Yes, yes, the last bit's more offputting than flattering, and it's weird so many media people own one, but, eh; I'm getting paid.

Text: I have no idea what happens in my head when I do math. I awake from a fugue state, answer on the board. "Oh no… Not again…", I cry, tripping over the body, wiping blood from my mouth. If you know a better algorithm for adding three-digit numbers, I'd love to hear it.

Text: @Durgesh99698338 @FakeLauraLouise @arishish After taking time to calm down and mull over my evening gomutra, I agree now too. I am become as bad as this fucking guy, and I apologize. https://t.co/06LyOug8Ng

Text: To achieve anything worthwhile in art, you must force yourself to be original, to stand apart from the echo chamber crowd, to shed the imitation of your erstwhile peers. This is why Beethoven deliberately deafened himself, the source of his musical genius.

Text: @infiniteaviary I don't know that it's a lack of originality. I just think it's a lack of jokes. Mere loudness where someone should have written a joke. The hot dog suit car crash sketch was excellent, though. Couple other ok ones, but mostly, rather a disappointment relative to the praise.

Text: @christianpbrink @infiniteaviary Job interview (push vs pull) was one of the ones I thought ok. Short and sweet, a nice blackout to open the series with. Then 20 other sketches in the series were the exact same premise done again without much twists (e.g., the choking sketch).
