Text: I keep thinking I have brilliant thoughts in the shower, and rush to write them down. But when I examine them later, they're not that great. Not sure what's going on. Something about staring down at my naked body causes my standards to drop precipitously.

Text: Apart from that the BBQ article was making the same "Hey, why not look to more traditional BBQ regions instead..." point that everyone making fun of it was making, it was also reposted content from 4 years ago. Everyone went nuts over some nothing nobody article from 4 years ago.

Text: I thought tweeting might help me become a sharper, tighter comic, and there's some of that brevity as soul of wit stuff, but I think its larger effect is ensnaring my mindset and sense of humor in a rather insular meme world in which few jokes are made to stand any test of time.

Text: It's cool how people get enraged over Arial vs. Helvetica, or Windsor vs. half-Windsor vs. four-in-hand, or eating this food with that condiment, with those utensils held this way (good God, no!), or…; it's cool each little novelty becomes a highly developed shibboleth hellhole.

Text: Norm Macdonald is amazing, because the stuff everyone remembers him for are the hackiest topics of the 90s (OJ, …) and some inane repeated catchphrases ("You guessed it... Frank Stallone!"), and yet somehow, despite all that, he is also the funniest human there is; the greatest.

Text: @ProfBootyPhD @DoolittleTalks That's the one. From some corny old jokebook. Granted, best moment of any roast ever is not a high bar, as roasts are, excepting this one bit, all entirely terrible.

Text: (It was silly that I even felt the need to add this disclaimer, as though the only way to remain morally pure oneself is to never publicly enjoy the work of someone who ever said anything dumb without immediately calling it out. Defensiveness I sometimes feel online.)
