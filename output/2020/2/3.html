Text: I've been doing laundry every week since 2000 or so, and yet there's still more to do. I've barely made a dent.

Text: I had my sympathies, before your lot resorted to criticizing and disagreeing with people. A strikingly Trumpian move. You disgust me.

Text: My lying cheating whore of an ex-wife. If only I'd divorced her while I had the chance. If only I'd foreseen she'd have this affair with the local necrophile.

Text: I predict low results for every candidate tomorrow, results which do not add to nearly 100%, extrapolating from how far down my own numbers have been this weekend. It's a bad time for numbers, a bear market.

Text: @JadeMasterMath @johncarlosbaez @nikitadanilov @TChihMath @silvascientist Same way, a subset of X x Y has no intrinsic direction. It's the condition that every x is related to a unique y that provides the direction.

Text: @JadeMasterMath @johncarlosbaez @nikitadanilov @TChihMath @silvascientist Incidentally, representing relations as subsets is your favorite, the Grothendieck construction again. And the quotient representation is the dual cocomma (but, in the context of sets, reflected from a directed poset collage into an undirected set).

Text: @schala163 @JadeMasterMath @johncarlosbaez @nikitadanilov @TChihMath @silvascientist Think of a set as a category (a category with only identity morphisms, or less evilly, where every morphism is invertible and every automorphism is identity).

And think of truth values as sets (sets with at most one element, considered true just in case they are inhabited).

Text: @JadeMasterMath @johncarlosbaez @nikitadanilov @TChihMath @silvascientist If you take jointly maps into sets A and B, then form the cocomma within Cat, you get a poset, with elements of A below those elements of B they are related to. That's the "collage" representing this relation. To turn this back into a set, you have to make these "&lt;"s into "="s.

Text: @schala163 @JadeMasterMath @johncarlosbaez @nikitadanilov @TChihMath @silvascientist Then a relation is a category-valued bifunctor on categories (specifically, truth value-valued bifunctor on sets), so it has a representation as a two-sided fibration; aka, the Grothendieck construction.

Text: @JadeMasterMath @johncarlosbaez @nikitadanilov @TChihMath @silvascientist The reflection is that Set sits inside Poset (indeed, inside Cat) as a reflective subcategory.

Text: @JadeMasterMath @johncarlosbaez @nikitadanilov @TChihMath @silvascientist Consider how a bifunctor A^{op} x B -&gt; Cat yields a two-sided fibration mapping into A x B. Now consider what happens when this bifunctor's range is only truth-values ((-1)-categories, as people say; discrete categories with at most one object). What map into A x B do you get?

Text: @dodecahedra To be clear, my purpose here was to consider a symmetry: if we say a function is unchanged by post-composing the canonical injection from a subset into a set, why not say a function is unchanged by pre-composing the canonical surjection from a set into a quotient set?

Text: @dodecahedra Of course, the reason set theorists (meaning material set theory, as opposed to structural set theory) speak as they do is because they consider every object to come with a canonical structure as subobject of some universal superclass, but do not symmetrically think of …

Text: @dodecahedra every object as coming with a canonical structure as quotient object of some universal pre-quotient. And we've all been trained by caprice of history and curricular standardization to think, at first, this is the natural and clean way of doing things.
