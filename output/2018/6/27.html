Text: There was a while there when kids were doing great on the SAT: 2200s, even 2300s! A bright and hopeful future lay ahead of us. But now they're all back to rarely cracking 1500; a generation of drooling morons. I blame fidget spinners.

Text: @haircut_hippie I'm honestly pissed off they switched it back. It's ruined my go-to SAT joke. Thankfully, I've salvaged it into this form instead, but I always prefer presenting myself as the outstanding moron.

Text: Well, I started it off with seven scattershot but, I think, insightful posts, and I'll keep going from there. I'll wait till I've put up a lot more content before actually letting anyone see it, though. Launch with a bang rather than a whimper. Maybe some more organization too.

Text: I also started a Slack, yes, a fucking Slack, with some pals from grad school, to serve as a virtual seminar for discussing (and thus writing up…?) my PhD research. Let's see if that works. Let's see if I can keep that up even once I have a job and an apartment and a life again.
