Text: Step 1. Elect Bernie.

Step 2. Make it illegal to be old. Bill is championed and signed by Bernie in a moment of age-related forgetfulness.

Step 3. Bernie is taken to jail, no longer needed. Caliphate of the Zoomers.

Text: @ohhimariss @AnnieLinskey I welcome with open arms all Warren supporters who now wish to support Bernie. The more, the merrier. I should hope they do not refrain because I used a metaphor about as tame as any hundred year old political cartoon, nor really take me into account at all in evaluating Bernie.

Text: @Discourse_Stu If you start with very long division (computing X / Y by just trying every possible thing to multiply Y by, till one of them gets you to X), doing this for a bunch of examples, you will probably on your own eventually discover "long division", to save yourself time.

Text: @Discourse_Stu None of it matters very much, though. Very long division already gives you a conceptual understanding of division, and we have calculators to take away the wait. There's no need for every child or adult to drill themselves on "long division", unless they are interested in it.
