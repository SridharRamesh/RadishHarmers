Text: @matthewaraven 100% "He was Obama's VP". That's it. And why was he Obama's VP? Just to pick some bland white guy to comfort voters who might worry a black guy heading the ticket was too radical. No qualifications at all, beyond being old white guy enough to serve this one role in November 2008.

No one's ever had a single helpful experience with them, but since so many never actually deal with them in any significant way, they somehow maintain rosy images on purely theoretical grounds, making them politically impossible to get rid of. https://t.co/4nT8sBt5FF
