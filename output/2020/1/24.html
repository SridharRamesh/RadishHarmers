Text: RT @RadishHarmers: There's no biggest number. There's a second-biggest number, but that's it. They don't get any higher than that.

Text: If you vote for a candidate, and also a bad person votes for that candidate, then you endorse the other voter's badness and are bad yourself. Endorsement is what mathematicians call a Euclidean relation. Euclid, by the way, was bad, though the proof is a rather messy diagram.

Text: Bernie is like me. Someone says something nice about him, he reflexively shares it, wanting people to know. He must have the exact same insecurities and drive for praise as me. The same inability to act like we've been there before.

Text: @HorridHenryVIII Yes, that's right. Though if David Frum suffered a traumatic brain injury and started endorsing Bernie, they'd suddenly recognize the monstrousness of Frum, and the need to reject all he endorses.

Text: "You could dig up dirt on every single human being that's ever existed if you catch them in their worst moment and you magnify those moments, and you cut out everything else and you only display those worst moments"? Just the thing someone with at least one bad moment would say.

Text: Actors love to play characters being really bad at acting, to make it look like acting is hard. Whatever. I'll be impressed by your acting skill when you show me you're capable of playing a masterful actor acting markedly better than you can actually act. That's masterly acting.
