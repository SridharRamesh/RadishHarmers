<pre>@Sturgeons_Law Who has this much nostalgia for Sister Act and The Mighty Ducks? I don&#39;t understand why all these nostalgic resurrections work.</pre>

<pre>@banalplay Hm, fuck, I didn&#39;t think this through. I&#39;m not sure how to carefully balance the joke I intended (most people are not able to customize their genitals) against more nuanced reality (people can customize their genitals, it&#39;s fine). I think I&#39;d better delete it.</pre>

<pre>@littmath The answer I would be inclined to give from the above is that it then follows that A = 1. But your posing this question to me suggests this does not follow, that we can have A^{3^k} = 1 without A = 1, even though A is 2 x 2 and we are in characteristic 3. Let me see why that is.</pre>

<pre>@littmath I could be wrong that the order of A has to be a power of p (in this case, a power of 3). Or I could be wrong that the order of A is at most n (in this case, 2).</pre>

<pre>@littmath Oh, ok, whether A^m = 1 and whether (A - 1)^m = 0 match when m is a power of 3, but not for other m. It&#39;s ok for the nilpotence order of A - 1 to not be a power of 3, so long as the order of A remains a power of 3.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@littmath So the order of A, given that it is a power of 3 at all, will be the smallest power of 3 which is at least the nilpotence order of A - 1. Conceivably, the nilpotence order of A - 1 could be as great as n. Can we do this in a way where A has order a power of 3?</pre>

<pre>@littmath Ok, consider these two conditions:

1. A raised to some power of p is 1.

2. The minimal polynomial of A is a power of (A - 1).

These two conditions are equivalent.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@littmath If A^(p^k) - 1 = 0, then by Frobenius (A - 1)^(p^k) = 0, so the minimal polynomial is (A - 1)^m for some m at most p^k. Reversely, if the minimal polynomial is (A - 1)^m, then letting p^k be at least m, we have that (A - 1)^(p^k) = 0, and thus by Frobenius A^(p^k) - 1 = 0.</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>@littmath So the condition we are told at the outset is that (A - 1)^m is the minimal polynomial of A, for some m, and we are asked for its order. Its order must divide some power of p and thus be a power of p itself; it will therefore be the smallest power of p upper-bounding m.</pre>

<pre>@littmath How large can this be? m can be as large as n, and so this can be as large as the smallest power of p upper-bounding n.

I was off by one, in some sense.</pre>
