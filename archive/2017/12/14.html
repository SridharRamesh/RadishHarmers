<pre>@pookleblinky It&#39;s not obvious to me how to win. The guaranteed winning strategies are only known for small boards, and via exhaustive computer search (though it&#39;s beautifully simple to nonconstructively prove the first player can force a win).</pre>

(Although I&#39;m still not sure why you wouldn&#39;t just get insurance for some of the same reasons anyone does; hedge against the financial loss of catastrophic tragedy, even though in this case you could comfortably weather it.)</pre>

<pre>TV criticism is just impossible these days. Everyone thinks good TV is about watching good people (likable people you want to be friends with) have good things happen to them, perhaps occasionally punctuated by simply bad people having bad things happen, then back to our friends.</pre>

<pre>@christapeterso You&#39;re looking for TV shows like this? I&#39;m saying most TV criticism I find is like this; praising or tut-tutting each episode of each TV show to precisely the extent it adheres to or departs from this standard. Which is uninteresting commentary to me.</pre>
