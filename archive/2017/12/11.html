<pre>A lot of people are firmly convinced Hindu swastikas turn oppositely from Nazi ones, in accordance with some traditional good/bad distinction (Nazis in full-on &quot;Are we the baddies?&quot; mode…), when two seconds of Google Image Search shows this to be manifestly overwhelmingly false.</pre>

<pre>I would never eat a fruit without washing it first; the ritual was firmly ingrained in childhood. Not an even an orange. Not even a banana. If you hand me an unwashed fruit to eat, I will slap that shit to the ground like it&#39;s arsenic.</pre>

<pre>@Sturgeons_Law &quot;swastika&quot; and &quot;sauwastika&quot;, yes. So people say. It&#39;s not clear to me that &quot;sauwastika&quot; is a traditional Hindu term for the counterclockwise swastika at all; this seems to have been made up by Eugène Burnouf.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@Sturgeons_Law Yeah, but even the Buddhists don&#39;t consider one the &quot;good&quot; swastika and the other the &quot;bad&quot; swastika, right? That seems to be a key component of this urban legend (which is also bizarrely often stated as though the Nazi swastika turns oppositely from how it actually does…).</pre>
