<pre>Lot of pure alliteration suggestions here, all appreciated, but as &quot;limousine liberal&quot;, &quot;latte liberal&quot;, and &quot;champagne socialist&quot; are all existing terms, I&#39;d like to fill in the blank in similar vein. (Yes, I didn&#39;t demand this for conservatives; so the situation goes.)</pre>
