<pre>Music is unbearable to listen to, with my favorite artists worst of the lot, naturally. After all, I spent so much time cheering myself up with it during the most painful periods in my life. The associations are too strong. I&#39;ve Ludovicoed myself out of the medium.</pre>

<pre>@JortsAuthority If my tweet should happen to ever go viral, I endorse this as its &quot;Wow, this really blew up! While you&#39;re here, check out...&quot; companion link. (But my tweet had better go viral. This is conditional endorsement.)</pre>

<pre>I genuinely believe the solution to this sort of bullshit is that college should not have merit-based admission, or significantly selective admission at all. I hardly see why things should be set up this way, with this scarcity mindset for education. https://t.co/EIGkULGuRD</pre>

<pre>Of course, people aren&#39;t genuinely chasing education, as such, but rather, credentials, whose zero-sum value comes from their gatekeeping. That&#39;s the system. (I&#39;m repeating points I&#39;ve already said, because I feel like repeating myself.)</pre>

<pre>I used to love Douglas Adams, but haven&#39;t re-read him in years. But I&#39;d hate for it to turn out he&#39;s Bad. Like Python et al, I hope the way a bunch of nerdy dipshits enjoy him doesn&#39;t rule out how nerdy non-dipshits could enjoy him too. Anything good attracts a spectrum of fans.</pre>

<pre>@martsendo Somewhat related is the matter of how I feel about some work not merely enjoyed by but in fact produced by authors who are themselves in many ways dipshits or worse. But that is a conversation it would be very, very difficult to get into on Twitter.</pre>

<pre>Looking back at my life, reflecting on various &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; moments (the first time I heard about Sliding Doors (1998); the first time I saw Sliding Doors (1998); oh, this one instance in which I wrote a tweet about Sliding Doors (1998), my finger hovering over the buttonâ€¦).</pre>
