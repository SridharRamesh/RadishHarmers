Text: How odd that the reaction to physical theft can be to then worry about "identity theft". At once a heightening, but also somewhat opposite.

Text: Feeling dumb and anxious and irrationally scared of leaving or returning home at night. Logging onto Twitter for entertainment and distraction. Scrolling through the timeline and... Oh, that's an unfortunate coincidence. https://t.co/MuMYShjjRn

Text: I very rarely wish I was big and strong, because it is of little practical use in ordinary life in the modern era. I can already reach every shelf I ever need to access, and open every jar I ever want to open.

Text: I hope they at least try the pickle, barfi, curry, etc, so it doesn't go to waste. My mother put a lot of time and work into those.

Text: I keep thinking how my muggers prolly get more out of the $ from my stuff than me, relative affluence considered (after all, I could afford it in the 1st place), but I'd still rather we sat down and agreed on a civil redistribution rather than the transaction occurring as it did.

Text: @negrosubversive I mean, I get that that preferable option wasn't readily available. I genuinely go back and forth on how to feel about this whole thing; on whether being upset about it makes me somehow a bad, hypocritical pseudo-leftist, too attached to personal property and shaming of violence.

Text: Nothing has ever actually matched the"Golden Spiral", "Golden Ratio", etc, in more than an "Everything sort of looks like everything else; any 2 objects can be lined up along an edge..." sense.

Well, there are some few pinecone/sunflower Fibonacci things, I guess, but that's it.

Text: I invent the world's first time machine, and rush to the founding of the US Patent Office. Lengthy line, all claiming credit for same.

Prior art discovered in ruins of Mesopotamia: exact duplicate of my machine, including my monogram on the control panel. My patent is rejected.

Text: @non_computable Don't worry. This is self-awarely partly facetious, or tongue-in-cheek, or whatever the right term is for recognizing a thought as humorous and playing it out in absurd exaggeration. But I appreciate your concern.

Text: The "and so on" is misleading. My Millennial superpower is that, if something is most conveniently handled by making a phone call, I have zero anxiety, even jokey anxiety, about doing it, talking to a stranger to get what I want. I remember the world of doing everything by phone.
