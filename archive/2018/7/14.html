<pre>I liked but didn&#39;t love Sorry to Bother You. Its politics were in the right place, but as a film, it was all over the place.

There&#39;s no reason anyone needs to know my opinion, but there&#39;s also no good reason I say any of the things I say on this site.</pre>

<pre>@matthewaraven This depends on what you&#39;re looking for in a movie-watching experience, and how much you value money. I can say I don&#39;t regret my purchase.</pre>

<pre>All the people with very specific political ideologies based on very specific dead Communists would hate me if they knew my point of view was cobbled together from Garfield comics, the first half of Office Space, and imagining the essay &quot;The Right to be Lazy&quot; might be describing.</pre>

<pre>Corruption in gymnastics judging runs deep in its standards. If you pull off a run of incredible athletic acrobatic flips and twirls, I don&#39;t care if you &quot;stick&quot; the landing. You&#39;ve earnt a right to sit down at the end. It&#39;s the convoluted journey, not the contrived destination.</pre>
