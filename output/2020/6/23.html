Text: As usual, on both this and the 30 Rock episodes taken down [by Tina Fey's own request, to be fair], I disagree with making our taboos the mechanical superficial rubric, rather than considering what a joke (or whatever) is actually saying. https://t.co/X8CbJLxi7a

Text: One might also say these jokes, even if not unethical per se, just aren't funny. That comics have gone to this well too often. That's de gustibus,  and for me a case-by-case judgement. But regardless, the "Do not portray!" taboo is clearly asserting more than mere comedic flab.

Text: I realize lots of people always say this. Yeah, lots of people say it because it's correct.

I also realize that this discourse is perfectly well covered by other people, comes up all the time, is tedious, and will not be changed by my adding to it.

Text: @reezels In our particular discourse bubbles. As with many such things, it's hard to know exactly what opinions are like in the populace in large.

Lots of old comics complain about this sort of thing boringly on stage all the time, I've noticed. Often largely in the right, but boringly.

Text: My irking about this is also far from the most important thing to irk about. Most important is systemic racist oppression in 1000 material ways, police brutality, etc, of course. But I still irk about this sometimes. Yes, partly selfishly because I fear getting ensnared in it.

Text: Now, the objection to the David Cross sketch could be raised that it's a bit copaganda: the driver is annoying and we're to sympathize with the cops brutalizing him. Sure. I'd agree with that critique. Not to an extent that I think this silly sketch ought be taken down, though.

Text: @Matute295 Yeah, bad timing on this one. During quarantine, on a work day, I'd rather be 25 than 35, and so on. But beggars can't be choosers.

Text: He's married now, to some wife I've never met, and rarely talks to me or responds if I reach out. Both my high school best friend and Trent Reznor.

Text: Remembering high school, when my best friend had recently heard NIN's Closer and described it to me as "Trent Reznor being shockingly overtly gay. I didn't know he was gay", with emphasis on lines like "I want to feel you from the inside", which he saw as "super homoerotic".

Text: Clearly comedians have gone to this well so often. As I said, it has perhaps been run rather dry comedically. But I don't see reason to memory-hole it all, as though ethically unconscionable. I also don't think all the things being categorized as blackface are quite the same.

Text: @Discourse_Stu Another irk this touches upon is copyright. If it was easier to just have a convenient store of everything ever made, then I wouldn't care what Netflix, etc, kept curated to maintain their image as unassailably good. But then, they wouldn't have a reason to exist either.
