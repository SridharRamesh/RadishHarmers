Text: Hoping to type furiously and finish my dissertation in the few days left before starting my job and losing all free time again. That'd be nice.

Text: Tinder forcing me to swipe one by one through a random, unpersonalized cross-section of its userbase is poor design. 95% of people might as well be aliens to me, our lives are so different, and I'd no more be into them than they into me.

Text: @maryashariq Haha, oh, that definitely won't and can't happen. But maybe I'll be able to summon the discipline to do it in spare time on evenings or weekends over some months. That would also be very nice, and could maybe, maybe, unlikely but maybe, happen.

Text: Set up most of the basics, and restored most of my old stuff from backups. Will want to test some more of the backups later, and then transfer my single Backblaze license over to the new machine, but for now, things seem mostly good.

Text: The "hot take" incentivizing mistake is the (unspoken) supposition truth has any particular tendency to track novelty, or falseness triteness. Some of the most shopworn, hackneyed positions are, in fact, correct. Others, diametrically opposite to so. It is all very case-by-case.

Text: @marx_knopfler @rahuldan Well, presumably, the "theorem" is that intervals of "real numbers" are, in fact, connected in this sense. (Although this could still be trivial or nontrivial depending on foundational system; one could choose, or not, to take this as axiomatic to one's notion of "real numbers".)

Text: @marx_knopfler @rahuldan Trivial to what extent? Certainly we must be invoking something special about the "reals", to distinguish from, say, the rationals with the analogous interval topology. So to prove the IVT is to make explicit whatever that distinguished something is, and its relevance for this.

Text: @marx_knopfler @rahuldan Well, it all depends on how you define the "reals", as I said. You could take this connectedness as an axiomatic property of theirs, or you could work in a context in which the chain from the reals' definition to their connectedness was not so formally immediate. It all depends.

Text: @marx_knopfler @rahuldan It's interesting, at least to me, to think about the distinctions possible here in subclassical (e.g., intuitionistic) logics between, say, non-isomorphic structures of "Cauchy reals", "Dedekind reals", etc., and how different phrasings of the IVT do or don't hold for them.

Text: @marx_knopfler @rahuldan To each their own, sincerely. But you must remember, my area was logic and "foundations", though I don't particularly like the conception of it as "foundations" (as though one couldn't properly do math X without first doing math Y, when it is manifestly both possible and normal).

Text: @marx_knopfler @rahuldan Yeah, that's what my advisor worked on a bunch and I guess got most famous for. One of the three sections of my qualifying exams was on typed and untyped lambda calculus and its semantics. (FWIW, the other two were Category Theory, and Intuitionistic Logic/Mathematics)
