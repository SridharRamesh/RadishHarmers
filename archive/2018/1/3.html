<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So I got everything back from my suitcase except my toiletry bag, amazingly enough (apparently, the muggers really wanted my toothbrush). Nothing back from my laptop bag, of course. Also, various foods I was looking forward to had spoiled. Still, an unexpectedly nice recovery.</p></blockquote>
