<pre>@Vint13 @rahuldphys @vinayaravind @CarlBeijer The ambiguity is made up by crybaby pedants. No one is ever confused by this, any more than people are confused by the fact that &quot;The right phrasing&quot; can mean both &quot;the correct phrasing&quot; or &quot;the politically conservative phrasing&quot; or &quot;the phrasing on the →&quot;.</pre>

Good. I love it. Let them.</pre>

<pre>@Vint13 @rahuldphys @vinayaravind @CarlBeijer Who says they&#39;re abusing philosophical jargon to sound smart? It&#39;s your misreading to assume they are trying to invoke philosophical jargon. They have no such intention. They are just using a stock phrase in their native language.</pre>

<pre>@Vint13 @rahuldphys @vinayaravind @CarlBeijer My whole point all along has been that it&#39;s perfectly fine to say a word or phrase that has multiple meanings and potential ambiguity. That&#39;s how ordinary language works and it&#39;s fine. Human language needn&#39;t be pared down for dumb robots who trip and fall on each Gricean pebble.</pre>
