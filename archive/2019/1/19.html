<pre>This damned topicality. Like old talk show monologues, none of these topical jokes will stand the test of time. All these trendy posts about 1889.</pre>

<pre>Going back in time to before anyone ever did any jokes about going back in time to kill Hitler, so I could be first to the untapped genre, stunning in my originality. As I get up at the open mic, ready to go, the portal opens and 1000 bodies descend, fighting to slit my throat.</pre>

<pre>I had the above thought several years ago. My overly skittish sketch group refused to let me do it. Later, a popular webcomic person independently posted a variant of the same joke. This is an exceedingly well-explored genre, after all; nothing stays original forever.</pre>
