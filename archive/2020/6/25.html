<pre>The year 2080. At last, everyone can code. Poverty still exists. If you wanted more money, you should&#39;ve learnt a rare skill like driving.</pre>

<pre>I waited till 1990, when You Can&#39;t Do That On Television went off air, to first say the words &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. I also avoided the names of all liquids. My parents, worried by my late language development, arranged an aide who slowly taught me &quot;water&quot;, The Miracle Worker style.</pre>

<pre>The success of Columbus&#39;s journeys was not due to better information than his critics on Earth&#39;s shape, but rather, enormous luck regarding its size (to wit, that its western edge falls between Russia and Alaska, and not, as was scholarly opinion of the time, mid-Atlantic Ocean).</pre>

<pre>DEBUNKING THE MYTH

Columbus, like most common men of his day, believed the world to be round. However, the well-educated had known even since antiquity, just as we now do, that the world is actually flat, as can easily be demonstrated by looking at any map.</pre>

<pre>Of course I&#39;m going to stay up late. Of course I&#39;m going to deprive myself of as much sleep as possible, till barely bearable. Don&#39;t you know we have only a finite lifespan? Don&#39;t you want to get your money&#39;s worth, desperately grabbing onto all the consciousness you can?</pre>

<pre>The Oscars change their minds about the Best Actor each year. A troubling lack of stability in the Academy. I can put no faith in its recommendations.</pre>

<pre>I only listen to two genres of music. Everything except country, or everything except rap, depending on my mood. Sometimes I listen to everything except country-everything except rap-fusion.</pre>

<pre>The pattern continues up through 5,149,108,636, but then 5,149,108,637 is even and 5,149,108,638 is odd. Mathematicians couldn&#39;t notice before because computing technology only recently made the calculations feasible.</pre>

<pre>As I recall, as is common with Netflix shows, the first season was more creative than later ones. But this is only a comment on the comedic quality. Ethically, it&#39;s all fine. To some extent, what makes later seasons less interesting is more Very Special Episode flavor.</pre>
