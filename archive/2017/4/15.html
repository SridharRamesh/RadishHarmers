<pre>@AlbinoHorse @alexnpress Sooo many angry ppl online take that bit as LD herself speaking sincerely, rather than awarely writing a deluded character. It&#39;s infuriating</pre>

<pre>@harikondabolu I remember this coming up w/the statues back when. Is transphobia really the prob? Seems to me the prob&#39;s that it&#39;s body-shaming simpliciter</pre>

<pre>@aerialsloveppl @harikondabolu Yeah; this &quot;It&#39;s transphobic!&quot; arg went round with the Trump statues with tiny penises back when. I didn&#39;t get it then and don&#39;t get it now.</pre>

<pre>@aerialsloveppl @harikondabolu it seems people feel it only gains moral currency as a trans issue? We don&#39;t need to frame it that way. Cis body-shaming&#39;s problematic too.</pre>
