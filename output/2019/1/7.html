[Note that Rot^{A + B) = Rot^A * Rot^B (rotating by angle A + B is as good as rotating by angle B then rotating again by angle A), justifying the exponential notation.]

Text: @marx_knopfler Now, we ask the question, what is d/dθ Rot^θ?

Well, it's the rotation matrix which sends v to d/dθ Rot^θ v.

This "d/dθ Rot^θ v" describes the velocity of someone swinging around a circle, from a starting position of v and currently having swung by angle θ.

To figure out what that scalar is, we now consider not just the direction of the velocity but its speed. [Damn character limits]…

[If you only ever measure angles in radians, rad is just 1, but I like to keep track of units for angles]

Text: @marx_knopfler Still, to save characters on this hellsite, let's take rad = 1 for now...

So now we know d/dθ Rot^θ v = Rot^{90°} Rot^θ v.

We also have the usual calculus language of ln, that lets us say d/dθ Rot^θ v = ln(Rot) Rot^θ v.

Which is to say, Rot = e^{Rot^{90°}}.

These are all just different language for the same thing.

Text: @marx_knopfler This is Euler's theorem already, but directly in the language of rotation.

The translation to the usual way people put it comes from noting that Rot^{90°}^2 = Rot^{180°} = -1, so Rot^{90°} = sqrt(-1).

So we can rephrase our discovery as that Rot^θ = e^{sqrt(-1) θ}.

They come from that cos and sin are the components of rotation, and rotation in all its glory satisfies F'' = -F.

Let ψ(N) = ln(the LCM of 1, 2, 3, ..., N). The statement I made is equivalently that ψ(N) / N → 1 as N → ∞.

Let π(N) be the number of primes below N. The Prime Number Theorem is that π(N) / (N/ln(N)) → 1 as N → ∞.
