<pre>I thought we had all agreed on Pre-Taped Call-In Show and The Audition as the top? Perhaps so much so it is trite to list them, like naming the Beatles as one&#39;s favorite band. Monsters of Megaphone is indeed delightful. Jay&#39;s best, of course, is The Story of The Story of Everest. https://t.co/w3K1WPXk5v</pre>

<pre>C&#39;mon, man. No one&#39;s even going to remember any of these superhero movies in thirty years. That&#39;s not cinema. That&#39;s not art. Hundreds of years from now, our descendants will take their inspiration from enduring classics like Clerks. https://t.co/fgjfrTPhVH</pre>
