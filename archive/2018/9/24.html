<pre>@sigfpe @johncarlosbaez It&#39;s also worth noting that an arithmetical statement like the Riemann Hypothesis is unaffected by Choice; that is, if ZFC proves it, then so does ZF simpliciter (by proving it relativized to L instead of full V, say, and noting N in L is the same as N in V).</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe @johncarlosbaez (Yes, ostensibly the Riemann Hypothesis is not a statement about N directly, but it&#39;s well understood how to show it equivalent to various statements about natural number arithmetic (indeed, a Pi-1 statement), by methods that have nothing to do with Choice)</pre>

<pre>Perhaps I should have targeted my workout plan more carefully. Not that all the exercise hasn&#39;t paid off, but it appears I&#39;ve mainly been getting my appendix swole.</pre>

<pre>Modern technology has been a godsend for my love of literature. As Kindles are so much thinner than traditional printed books, I have been able to store nearly three times as many on my shelves, thus nearly tripling the reading material in my library.</pre>

<pre>@shitshowdotinfo That is acceptable. Only those who seek to excoriate me must first pause and look up the context.</pre>

<pre>Twitter is now literally showing me the &quot;RT @so-and-so:&quot; headers on everything (in the app, though not on the webpage). On top of various other bugs, as always. This whole place is held together with not even duct tape, but Scotch. How the fuck is this a $20 billion company?</pre>

<pre>Apropos of nothing, I&#39;d like to note that I was a virgin on (and for many years after) September 20 of this year, March 15th of the last, and on a couple weekends in 2016 when my ex-wife was taking care of the kids.</pre>
