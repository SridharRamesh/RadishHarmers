<pre>@delmoi No one ever said the previous distance was 3&#39;, though. Perhaps the previous distance afforded to students was 6/sqrt(2)&#39; â‰ˆ 4&#39; 3&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@EthnicSteve @AbiWilks @AliceFromQueens Yeah, sure, she didn&#39;t do anything to earn interest, we&#39;re all free to ignore her, but that&#39;s the human condition. A sexagenarian worried on their birthday about their life passing unnoticed is hardly so monstrous.</pre>
