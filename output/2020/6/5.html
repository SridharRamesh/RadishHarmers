Text: @wcthunderesq Austerity is a question of how to allocate resources and power, which institutions get starved while which are fed. Any time someone is against austerity, they mean they want good things funded more, rather than other institutions.

Text: @wcthunderesq We're tying ourselves in overthinking knots if we think ramping down police is emboldening "austerity". I mean, c'mon. There's a line item labeled "Harass/Brutalize" and we're supposed to refrain from removing it because of some theory that this plays into our opponents hands?

Text: @wcthunderesq I'm as pessimistic as anyone on the chances of accomplishing goals. On the goals themselves, though, I think "Cutting police budgets is austerity to be avoided" is silly. If people think cutting police budgets is a good thing, I see no reason to scold them for that.

Text: @wcthunderesq What is the problem in people thinking police budgets are too high? I don't have the solution to everything I think is a problem, but I think this is on the level where one can say "Ok, if you're going to call people out for this opinion, what opinion ought they have instead?".

Text: @lastpositivist @dog_envier In this relevance mindset, how would you feel if ¬¨b were replaced with b ‚áæ ‚üÇ, where I am using ‚üÇ as shorthand for "All propositions hold"?

That is, how do you feel about the argument that a ‚áæ ((b ‚àß (b ‚áæ ‚üÇ)) ‚áæ b) because b ‚àß (b ‚áæ ‚üÇ) entails ‚üÇ which entails a ‚áæ b?

Text: @lastpositivist @dog_envier Alright, put another way, suppose I propose for ‚üÇ to mean a 0-ary disjunction to be handled uniformly in the same way 2-ary, 3-ary, 4-ary, ‚Ä¶, disjunctions are. Would you accept such a proposition to exist or reject its existence? And would ‚üÇ then entail all propositions?

Text: @lastpositivist @dog_envier The uniformity I have in mind is like so:

One is entitled to assert A v B v ‚Ä¶ entails Z once one has asserted each element of {A, B, ‚Ä¶} entails Z. With an n-ary disjunction, there are n such prerequisite entailments, from which it follows that A v B v ‚Ä¶ entails Z.

Text: @lastpositivist @dog_envier In particular, with 0-ary disjunction, there are 0 such prerequisite entailments, from which it follows that a 0-ary disjunction entails Z. I.e., nothing to wait for, ‚üÇ entails Z.

We could deny this uniformity, of course, but this is what I was wondering about.

Text: @lastpositivist @dog_envier I see it as true. To infer Z from A v B v ‚Ä¶, you need each of n many things to exist: a derivation of Z from each of the n elements of {A, B, ‚Ä¶}. There are n derivations which all must exist; if all n derivations exist, you're good to go.

Text: @lastpositivist @dog_envier The existence condition is true in this case because in this case, only 0 many things are required to exist. The condition is vacuous (granted, vacuity is just the sort of thing the relevance logician might wish to give special case consideration).
