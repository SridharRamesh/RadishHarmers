<pre>I always keep a condom in my wallet. You ever know how the night will go! For example, a friend may need a condom. (Or a wallet!). And one of these nights, I&#39;ll make that friendâ€¦ [walks off whistling]</pre>

<pre>It is near-uncontrollably funny to end a long fictional anecdote with the reveal of a name for its archetypally annoying character, about whom such a specific name says so much; Becky, Chad, etc. It&#39;s funny because it&#39;s true.
