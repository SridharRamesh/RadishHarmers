<pre>Times Square = times times times = Time Cube. Once I fully flesh out the theory and master time accordingly, I will travel back to 2002, where this last reference would be appreciated.</pre>

<pre>Free meals at school for any child who maintains at least a 3.0 GPA. Various programs of &quot;GPA credits&quot; for those from disadvantaged households. Decades down the road, the &quot;Fight for 2.0&quot;. Pragmatists note sympathies, but stress hard realities of the world, suggesting 2.5 instead.</pre>

<pre>@delmoi To be clear, what I am wowed by is the username &quot;Rebecca Schoenkopf, Wonkette Editrix, King of You&quot;. I haven&#39;t yet read any of the rest of these screenshots, but they look intriguing.</pre>

She and I don&#39;t need to get married just to fit your hidebound image of the ideal battery. Our progressive approach is doing just fine.</pre>

No idea if this mole on the back of my hand just appeared or if it&#39;s been there forever. Should&#39;ve been paying more attention.</pre>

<pre>Posting longer text as images is a hack, and once Twitter applies ad hoc cropping in ways that aren&#39;t obviously cropped, changing the perceived text, it becomes such a painful one. (+ lack of search, etc). I give up on what I was just trying. Forget it. Bring back macroblogging.</pre>

<pre>A lot of misanalysis starts with the idea money is a THING you have, so taxes take something away from you that was yours in the first place. But money isn&#39;t really a THING you have (especially at high wealth levels, $ isn&#39;t primarily some bag of material goods in your garage).</pre>
