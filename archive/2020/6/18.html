<pre>Once, a scribe was a learned expert and handsomely paid. Now if by the age of seven you don&#39;t possess their entire skillset, you&#39;re considered super dumb.</pre>

<pre>That first time as a child seeing fireworks, it was so exciting. What untold wonders the world had in store for me yet to discover. The next year, when I saw fireworks again, just the same, I understood what a fool I had been, and calibrated my expectations for life accordingly.</pre>

<pre>Didn&#39;t have to work yesterday? Must be a day ending in &quot;nday&quot;.

Had to work yesterday and will still have to work tomorrow? Must be a day ending in &quot;sday&quot;.

Had to work yesterday but will not have to work tomorrow? Things are really turning around. I&#39;m happy for you.</pre>

<pre>@babarganesh @hahahaohman @FecalMonsoon @ComradeLuanne The show as far as what math is does not rely on memorizing any particular digit strings, though it may naturally happen over time regardless. You shouldn&#39;t lie about math and say it cannot be done with a calculator.</pre>

<pre>@babarganesh @hahahaohman @FecalMonsoon @ComradeLuanne We invented calculators just like we invented decimal notation, in order to use them. They&#39;re easier than what came before, so there&#39;s no longer such need for what came before. Or ought we drill memorizing multiplication tables in Roman numerals as well?</pre>

<pre>@babarganesh @hahahaohman @FecalMonsoon @ComradeLuanne Everyone is able to multiply without a machine. Given time, they can write out the multiplication table for themselves. They understand perfectly. They just don&#39;t have it memorized for instant recall. Why is such speed important? When speed matters, use a calculator.</pre>
