<pre>A 55 year old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28 year old with three PhDs. Especially smarter, because this idiot has been thinking about three things for the last fifteen years. Don&#39;t look up whose quip this is. It&#39;s a good observation.</pre>

<pre>@silvascientist I don&#39;t believe I am. A garbage man has lived life freely thinking about a million things. A person with N PhDs has only thought about N things. Let me consult on the math with my co-writer and get back to you.</pre>

<pre>There are only three places. Any two places of the same kind are exactly the same. Any time a place seems to differ from another, all this means is that the percent composition of the three places in their local vicinities differ. Fundamental places. Perhaps the same for things.</pre>
