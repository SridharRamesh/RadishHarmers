Text: @tristanybother It depends on what you mean by "this". Taking repeated powers doesn't usually keep ending in the digits you started with, but you happen to have picked one of the other cases where it does. The sixth power of 5 ends in 25, the sixth power of 25 ends in 625, and so on forever.

Text: @tristanybother …1787109376 is built up in such a way that will always be 1 mod 2^N, and 0 mod 5^N. Those properties only depend on its last N digits, and will clearly ensure that its square, cube, etc, all match itself. But why does the fifth power trick work to build it up?

Text: @tristanybother One can quickly convince oneself from there it keeps producing the unique N digits which are 0 mod 2^N and 1 mod 5^N.

Similar reasoning shows that if you keep taking sixth powers starting with 5, you get the unique N digits which are 1 mod 2^N and 0 mod 5^N.

Text: @tristanybother Here, let me take stab #2 at giving the explanation pithily: Suppose X is even. Then clearly X^5 will contain at least one more power of 2. So every time you take fifth powers, X becomes zero mod a higher power of 2.

Text: @tristanybother Similarly, suppose X - 1 is divisible by 5. Then X^5 - 1 = (X - 1) * (1 + X + X^2 + X^3 + X^4).

Since X = 1 mod 5, the 1 + X + X^2 + X^3 + X^4 factor comes out to a multiple of 5. So X^5 - 1 contains one more power of 5 than X - 1 does.

Text: @tristanybother So every time you take fifth powers, X becomes 1 mod a higher power of 5.

So, starting with 6 (which is both even and 1 mod 5) and taking successive fifth powers, we get values which are zero mod each successive power of 2, and which are 1 mod each successive power of 5.

Text: @SeanMcCarthyCom In fairness, self-proclaimed leftists/Marxists/etc can fall into such traps too, hung up on the term "worker" and thus fetishizing life as needing to be work rather than leisure, in worker vs. shirker mindset, a la Soviet charges of "social parasitism".

Text: @SeanMcCarthyCom Usually leftists have the decency to not apply such thinking to the elderly, though.

Text: @HapmpL @SeanMcCarthyCom I gave a historical example already. The Soviet Union considered itself Marxist, yet went so far as to criminalize being insufficiently worker bee; e.g., Joseph Brodsky being sentenced to hard labor on the charge of being an odd job poet rather than a socially productive worker.
