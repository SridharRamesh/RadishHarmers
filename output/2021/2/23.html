Text: @matthewaraven I have leaned in to my position as music hater philistine and am going forward with it with just the facts justification in a way roughly similar to how Matt Bruenig often talks about some other things that get him accused of philistinism, 7-11s or electric stoves or whatever.

Text: @timmyj213 I had one haircut last summer and they seemed to handle it alright, so I'd be happy to do that again, except for paranoia about the new more contagious strain, maybe it being stupid if we're near the end with vaccines, etc. But we're probably not really anywhere near the end yet.
