<pre>At all times, I should be either productive or sleeping. I can tilt the balance between the two however I like, that&#39;s fine, but to spend so much time awake yet doing nothing, as I do? Madness. Foolishness. May posting this make me actually internalize its lesson.</pre>

<pre>Focusing as I fall asleep on the plot beats I&#39;ve outlined for the dream I would like to have tonight. Compelling dramedy with A- and B-stories linking up neatly at end. But some sound intervenes, and suddenly I&#39;m stuck helping my dead grandpa solve the Riddle of the Inca instead.</pre>

<pre>@annakhachiyan @martymacmarty I&#39;m not dunking on Anna qua Anna, just on this particular attitude about what comedy is for, currently ubiquitous. Anna sometimes says things I basically agree with and sometimes says things I think are dumb. In this case, I do think there&#39;s a hypocrisy in play worth considering.</pre>
