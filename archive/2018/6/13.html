<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Taking x! to be the integral of t^x/e^t dt over all positive t, as is often done, is there any simple/easy way to establish the asymptotic that (n + x)! ~ n! n^x for fixed x and large n (thus equating the integral and infinite product definitions of the generalized factorial)?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@loundcushblount At the moment, the best I&#39;ve got is the observation that the integral of t^x (1 - t/n)^n dt over t in [0, n] is n^(x + 1) * n!/((x + 1) * (x + 2) * ... (x + n + 1)). Taking the limit as n → ∞, the LHS becomes the integral def and the RHS the infinite product def of x!.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@loundcushblount That&#39;s pretty good, but it feels a little out of the blue, compared to starting from the integral definition and watching the asymptotics naturally fall out of it. I&#39;m hoping to discover something more straightforward along those lines, in some vague ineffable sense.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@loundcushblount Anyway, I retain the position that the infinite product def is usually far better as starting point, but sometimes the integral does come up (x^n/n! as the n-th integral of 1, w/fractional integration taken via Laplace transform), and one then wants to see the equivalence easily.</p></blockquote>
