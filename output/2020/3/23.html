Text: I carry a tote bag emblazoned with a picture of the many spices in my spice rack. Everyone asks for a photo with it. The mayor has offered me the key to the city. Everyone agrees I'm better than people who like different foods.

Text: It was confusing. Twitter has very strong policies against spreading election misinformation. People might have thought Joe Biden really dropped out and endorsed Bernie Sanders for president because he died. https://t.co/TDEWSQDNbF

Text: What I gather from people posting photos online is that Midtown is empty, but the parks and really every other neighborhood are still full of people out and about, not much different. Once again confirming what I've always said: no one goes to Midtown anymore, it's too crowded.

Text: Joe Biden hasn't been seen in a week because he has transformed himself, Fantastic Voyage style, to attack the coronavirus. Regular cameras are no longer up to the task, and scanning electron videography is poorly developed. A boom mic could crush him.
