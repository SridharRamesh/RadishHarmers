<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ligneousTyler @HelpfulKraken I see both @HelpfulKraken and I converged on the same idea framed similarly, playing out logically from the quoted tweet. I had not seen @HelpfulKraken&#39;s tweet until now (I get no validation jollies by stealing), but I acknowledge it was prior to mine. https://t.co/GjtKWHe8KI</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@jeb_bush_2020 @shreyabasu003 @rens_twi A domicile is too big for you to hope to not have any mosquitoes already in there somewhere, or be able to effectively purge the whole place if one gets in. A bed is the right size that you can establish it as mosquito free when you put up the net and thus keep it that way.</p></blockquote>
