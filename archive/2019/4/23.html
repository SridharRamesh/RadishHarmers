<pre>Classic rock band performing, audience starts singing along, rock band relents to let audience sing a line, then two lines, then the audience takes over the instruments too, the engineering, the roadies, the whole show. Audience fucking groupies, the works. Madness. Unacceptable.</pre>

<pre>Argh, no, for the tenth time, no. It was precisely in order to stave off any potential charges of Holocaust denialism that I arranged those ads in all the major papers in the first place, featuring my photo with the caption &quot;BIG BELIEVER IN HOLOCAUSTS&quot;.</pre>

<pre>It was only to emphasize my agreement with the factually correct position that I was smiling and giving a thumbs up. Would you have had me grimacing as though under duress, gesturing as though in dissent?</pre>

<pre>Spider-Man this, Spider-Man that. Psh, big deal; I could take that guy any day. It&#39;d be a walk in the damn park! MY incident left me with the proportional strength of a creature twice as strong as a spider, and ten fucking times as large.</pre>

<pre>Forgive all debt; I don&#39;t care. Erase the economy, it&#39;s fine by me. It&#39;s all made up. Make it up nicer. That&#39;d be fun. I haven&#39;t thought this through, but I&#39;ve thought enough about plenty of other things; let me have this.</pre>
