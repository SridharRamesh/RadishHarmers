<pre>Incidentally, I haven&#39;t arranged a ride back yet, so if any New Yorkers are driving back from Keene later with a spare seat, let me know. I can chip in for whatever, be entertaining, be silent, etc.</pre>

<pre>Everyone calm down. This quote is correct. The erroneous rounding process was necessary to yield integer results, which fully correct division would not do. https://t.co/XmPS7hn0FB</pre>

<pre>I&#39;m completely against a mandatory &quot;national service&quot; program for youth even if it isn&#39;t only via military service. I don&#39;t care. Elders make kids do enough bullshit for &quot;character&quot; and &quot;In my day…&quot; already. People shouldn&#39;t be forced to do anything.  Let them live their lives.</pre>
