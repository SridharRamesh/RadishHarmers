Text: @asmeurer Ah, yes, gotcha. But we have to presume then that #3 and #4 weren't seeded on the same side to begin with, even though clearly one was seeded on the same side as #1 and another on the same side as #2. That seems very difficult to be confident of arranging.

Text: @asmeurer All of this is just for theoretical fun, mind you. I wouldn't actually say teams have objective consistently comparable rankings, etc. I just wanted to tweet some non-programming perspective on what sorting algorithms do.

Text: There used to be no point being attracted to people on Twitter, because they all lived somewhere else. You were never going to meet up. Now it's the same even with dating apps in your city. Nothing to do but fuck your roommate, your pet, your roommate's pet, pet's roommate, etc.

Text: Politically, old people have had all hope squeezed out of them. They've narrowed and closed their aspirations through decades of Stockholm Syndrome. At least, this is the charitable interpretation.

Text: @jasonschreier @LawkOutTrolls Hardly too sensitive. Those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it. Six million Jews and 11 million Roma, LGBT, Slavs, disabled, and dissidents were murdered by movie comparisons.

Text: @C_Trombley1 This discovery straight up made me do a 180 on who to tease. The original review was bombastic, I laughed at it too, but there's nothing I hate more than this "You're not allowed to even talk about bad things unless I like you, or talk about talking, or…" faux-outrage move.
