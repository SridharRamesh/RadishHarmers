Text: @arishish @allahliker Never should've let dogs onto that plane.

(Interesting etymological side note: "screwed the pooch" is a bowdlerization of "fucked the dog" created by Tom Wolfe for The Right Stuff, the story of the first fighter pilots selected for the U.S. space program, who fucked dogs.)

Text: @yeetphilosopher Define accuracy however you want. The string of N results you get from sampling from probability distribution D a total of N many independent times has a probability distribution determined only by N and D, and not by any here unmentioned concept of "the population size of D".

Text: @reezels Now, 250 samples, allowing repetition in this way, would probably strike you as pretty useful for gauging the proportions of Yes and No among 10 people; not guaranteed to hit the proportions right on the nose, but a generally trustworthy way of getting likely very near them.

Text: @yeetphilosopher Yes, but nearly so. Sampling with replacement is the same as carrying out sampling w/o replacement with a randomly lowered sample size and corresponding sample re-weighting. And in the regime where collision is unlikely, difference between these is correspondingly negligible.
