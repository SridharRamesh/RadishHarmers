<pre>Near regardless of who the gatekeeping hammer comes down on, I&#39;m not fond of giant private corporations unilaterally deciding who is/isn&#39;t allowed access to broadcast themselves to interested listeners in a world where all distribution platforms are owned by, well, those corps.</pre>

<pre>I sense this isn&#39;t a terribly popular view right now, even among my left-mates, but so it goes. I have at least been consistent about it, and view it as consistent with my attitudes about concentrated private power in general. https://t.co/sWVmATgfY8</pre>

<pre>(Not that I&#39;m fond of government doing the same thing either, mind you. Anyway, the whole &quot;fake news&quot; paranoia has served to prepare the ground for some really distressing reaction-phenomena, I think.)</pre>

<pre>When the urge strikes me to express pleasantry online, I still reach for :) before any emoji. Teens pass by and laugh. The taunting grows, as more teens join. Soon, I am beset upon violently, my possessions snatched from me, and jeers all the while. I saw a few pre-teens as well.</pre>

<pre>When good things happen to other people, I feel bad, as I am made up of 70% jealousy by weight. When bad things happen to other people, I feel bad, as I have empathy for fellow humans. Bad things happening to me are bad as well, natch. The conditions under which I am happy are wh</pre>

<pre>I&#39;m over the math articles in Quanta magazine. They&#39;re a bit better than elsewhere, but still always overhyped and underdescriptive. Everything&#39;s the breakthrough of the century, and also, &quot;an important equation about numbers&quot;.</pre>
