<pre>Boy, technology has changed so much. As a child, I remember having to wait about six whole months for movies to come to VHS after playing in theaters. But now, it takes fucking forever.</pre>

<pre>My front-facing-camera comedy videos were written by, directed by, filmed by, and accidentally starred in by me, all while the many professional actors and expensive one-time practical effects I meticulously set up for each shot played out in vain on the good side of the phone.</pre>

<pre>My most popular tweet of all time (by Likes, though not by RTs, somehow). It&#39;s fine, but also a two-second toss-off, far from my list of personal favorites, my true darlings. I will never again fall for the myth that numbers closely track merit. https://t.co/Wy7yBWH7nB</pre>

<pre>@rahuldphys FWIW, my script included discussion of how to apply this technique to prove Brouwer&#39;s fixed point theorem and the Borsuk-Ulam theorem (to correct an error in 3blue1brown&#39;s previous discussion of Borsuk-Ulam), but we decided to split the video up, and then Part 2 never came to be.</pre>

<pre>@rahuldphys The function doesn&#39;t need to be analytic or meromorphic; just continuous. If you&#39;d like the codomain to be the Riemann sphere including directionless infinity too, this is acceptable, but these directionless infinities must be considered colorless in just the same way as zero is.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@rahuldphys If the function IS meromorphic, each positive winding number indicates a zero to be found within, but a negative winding number indicates a pole to be found within. A pole of order N contributes a winding number of -N, just as a zero of order N contributes a winding number of +N.</pre>

<pre>@rahuldphys Yes, the residue theorem is the special case of this applying to analytic (aka, holomorphic) or more generally meromorphic functions.</pre>

<pre>Since 1900, only once has a party taken the presidency for less than eight years (Jimmy Carter, over 40 years ago now). Perhaps one must think of the presidency as an eight year position with a rarely invoked early exit clause, not a four year gig that may be extended further.</pre>
