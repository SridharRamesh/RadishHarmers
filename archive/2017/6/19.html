<pre>@sigfpe @jcreed If PA proves P terminates, then P terminates. The previous sentence is provable in PA; thus, by Loeb&#39;s theorem, PA proves P terminates.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe @jcreed And because PA proves P terminates, we furthermore have that P does in fact terminate (by the implication in the first sentence).</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe @jcreed FWIW, my never-written PhD thesis was on a categorical logic abstraction and generalization of Loeb&#39;s theorem. I should write it up someday.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed @sigfpe Not sure why either, when they have the exact same proof; GIT/G2IT is just the case of Loeb&#39;s theorem for Falsehood.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed @sigfpe And the proof of GIT, if looked at in this light, works just as well for general Loeb.</pre>

<pre>@jcreed @sigfpe One distraction is phrasing GIT proofs in a way which makes them seem to rely on Law of Excluded Middle type reasoning, which is unnecessary</pre>
