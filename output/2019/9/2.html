Text: This dissent is part of the revolution you claim to want, that capitalism is still alienating and shitty even for many it privileges. I'd hardly shout at them that their unhappiness is unacceptable, that they should be thrilled with the status quo.

Text: Fight Club is an enjoyable movie and, just as with Office Space, it's fine and right for middle class (/white/male/etc) professionals to be disenchanted having to spend their lives working bullshit office jobs instead of whatever they and you too would rather do with leisure.

Text: You want to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, and criticize after dinner, just as you have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, or critic? Wow. Wow, privileged much? Be happy you have a good job and shut up with the unrelatable ennui.

Text: I fucked the wording up. I should've opened with more symmetric "Fight Club and Office Space are both enjoyable movies...", so I could just as well link to this next time either one comes up. Well, I'll get it right next time.

Text: They should make up a new term for being single but wanting not to be but not succeeding at such. We would keep the one word for the overwhelming majority of such cases (nascent murderers), but have the other term for the rare instances when this condition afflicts the non-evil.

Text: Tennis pros are such rank amateurs. No respect for the audience. They mess up serves, double fault and such. Every serve should be an ace. If there were a way to win on the very first move, no grandmaster would decide "Nah, I'm gonna move the rook diagonally instead. Twice.".
