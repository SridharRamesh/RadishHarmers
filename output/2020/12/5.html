Text: @nandelabra It's a five-second script for any editor or reader to re-standardize a document to whichever of these conventions they prefer, so let them worry about it. It's like fretting over whether students type straight apostrophes ' instead of curly apostrophes ’ or vice versa. Why worry?

Text: @nandelabra But again, all this stuff is relatively recent in history. For the vast majority of the history of writing, no one cared. I don't see why it's important to care about it now.

But I recognize the irony in my writing at such length about how important it is to not care!

Text: @DickCountry @herraero @nkulw It's common terminology to use "algebraic" to mean only rational coefficient polynomials; non-transcendental numbers are standardly called "algebraic numbers" for this reason. So that's ok. But he screws up in saying there are more transcendental numbers than irrational numbers.

Text: @SproutyJack @noamchungus @BiigNick @afraidofwasps 1. He says there are more transcendentals numbers than irrational numbers. This is false because every transcendental number is irrational. And even the non-transcendental irrational numbers are standardly provable to be of the same cardinality as the transcendental numbers.

Text: @SproutyJack @noamchungus @BiigNick @afraidofwasps 2. He says there are exactly five levels of infinity (in this cardinality sense). This is completely counter to the proof of uncountability at all. For every set, its powerset is strictly larger, by the same diagonalization argument or other such ones. There is no largest one.

Text: @SproutyJack @noamchungus @BiigNick @afraidofwasps 3. The third mistake is sort of a pedantic thing about using the aleph notation here, there's a common mistake people make about that notation, but actually, in light of his saying there are only five levels of infinity, maybe this part isn't a new mistake on top of that.
