Text: This damned topicality. Like old talk show monologues, none of these topical jokes will stand the test of time. All these trendy posts about 1889.

Text: Going back in time to before anyone ever did any jokes about going back in time to kill Hitler, so I could be first to the untapped genre, stunning in my originality. As I get up at the open mic, ready to go, the portal opens and 1000 bodies descend, fighting to slit my throat.

Text: I had the above thought several years ago. My overly skittish sketch group refused to let me do it. Later, a popular webcomic person independently posted a variant of the same joke. This is an exceedingly well-explored genre, after all; nothing stays original forever.

Text: The portal opens and I step out into the 1940s. "Oh god, this is cutting it close! I'll have to act fast". I sprint to a grocery and grab one of many easily-available Gros Michel bananas to taste. "Huh… This really IS better". I then return to the present before shit gets crazy.

Text: BTW, the Gros Michel didn't go extinct, it just became uneconomical to produce for mass consumption. I hope someday to find a specialty import grocery or greenhouse or whatever with one, and try it. I imagine it will be fine. There's so many kinds of bananas in India anyway.
