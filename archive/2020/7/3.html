<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@iowahawkblog It&#39;s marked &quot;nonstandard&quot; in this very screenshot, what do you want? The very entry you looked up notes this usage is documented since 1795. Merriam-Webster has had an entry for it since 1934. Nothing has happened, it&#39;s fine. Do you even like language?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@StavenRayborn @iowahawkblog They don&#39;t cancel each other out in this usage, clearly. It is a misanalysis to suppose they must. Negative concord is a common feature of natural language. Ain&#39;t no problem with it.</p></blockquote>
