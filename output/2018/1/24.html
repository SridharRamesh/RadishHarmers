Text: Hey, uh, is it really true that there are no individual PPOs in New York anymore, or should I be looking off the Marketplace?

Text: Where do I get an unbiased (or biased in my favor) benevolent expert to just figure out for me the best thing to do in my particular situation? (But, of course, I don't really see why things should be set up so that we should each have to bother figuring such things out at all…)

Text: RT @RadishHarmers: Naming the then-emerging literary/artistic/cultural movement "modernism" was the Y2K bug of the early 20th century.

Text: @tom7 In case it's not clear, this is the same joke I made, but using a different synonym. (The word more familiar to me from watching all those Ramayana and Mahabharata miniseries with terse, dismissive kings and such…)

Text: @tom7 It's pronounced like the English word "bus", so, yes, it also means that. I am surprised Google doesn't even acknowledge the other meaning, though.

Text: Obviously, you already know the Le Guin quote about capitalism and the divine right of kings, and obviously, today would be the day to post it if you didn't all already know it. But it's a good quote. A damn good quote. Obviously.

I cede one extra nomination to all my co-nominees, as well as my nominator.

Text: Nightmares about giant insects are the most horrifying experience. I'd rather have nightmares about bombs or gruesome serial killers or anything, really. Which is why I make sure to spend an hour each night before bed reading about and watching footage of gruesome serial killers.

Text: My opinions all change over time. They sway slowly but ultimately drastically, like drifting continents. I'm old enough to have observed it repeatedly, markedly, now. Perhaps by the end of my life, I'll have tasted every position at least once.

Text: People bag on "mixing metaphors", but I unironically like it, or at least like metaphor and don't care re: mixing. I like reading it, and I like doing it; why oughtn't it be a stylistic option?

[I won't bother doing it in this tweet. That'd make this a joke, and I'm not joking.]

Text: @soft_btw I suspect this is like when I beat Link to the Past the first time, without ever realizing there were two more swords you were supposed to find after the Master Sword. I just assumed all the boss battles were supposed to be long and hard and super tedious.

Text: @soft_btw Right, right (to clarify, I played and am familiar with FF7). I just didn't understand the "the mad of the ___" phrasing; does it mean you missed out on finding most of the summons?

Text: @rogerbellin You think "bottleneck" is meaningless just because it's so utterly common? (I said I "like metaphor", but maybe that wasn't entirely the relevant thing to say. I also like just using utterly standard language without worrying about the sort of "clash" involved in that example.)

Text: @rogerbellin Right, I don't, it acts like an etymological black box now, which is why "I like metaphor" was perhaps the wrong thing for me to say in explanation of why I often don't care about this sort of clash.

Text: Tangential observation: "Gild the lily" is the ultimate mixed metaphor, while also how some would describe the objectionable impulse leading to mixed metaphors.

(I don't note this with any significance; it's just a weird corrupted phrase that's now standard. But it's cute.)

Text: Ah, yes. How awful it would be to be forced to work for a living; a kind of "wage-slavery", if you will. How better it'd be to structure society to allow greater leisure for all, for their own pursuits. Clearly this man and I share a political ideology. https://t.co/nCUtMfjsRb

Text: AD-BC is a useful mnemonic for the 2 by 2 determinant, for the positive arrow of time, and for the name of the Nigerian guy with the hat on Oz. I answer all multiple choice quizzes starting thusly; the odds are strong.
