<pre>People need to stop turning each common name and word into sex things. There&#39;s only so many words to go around. There are other matters that occasionally need discussing.</pre>

<pre>I don&#39;t want to make small talk. I only want to talk about grand ideas, global phenomena affecting entire populations beyond individual minutiae, matters so lofty they were once considered windows into the dealings of the gods themselves, like the ever-shifting weather patterns.</pre>

<pre>George Bernard Shaw is (apocryphally) credited with using &quot;Ghandi&quot; in order to illustrate and lambast the inconsistencies of English orthography, arguing that analogy to other terms demands this be accepted as a possible spelling of the pronunciation &quot;fish&quot;.</pre>

<pre>The folks who get to run the world are achingly dumb, even in your fave&#39;s admin. It&#39;s all a big club and you&#39;re not in it; from this flow the facts of what issues they care about. The one good thing about Twitter is logging these mindsets to public record. https://t.co/y2Wecbzhek</pre>

<pre>Democrat powerholders falling all over themselves to condemn Maxine Waters because she had the temerity to suggest that members of the GOP admin deserve a bit of public censure for cruelly destroying brown kids&#39; families. Such an old joke at this point, but, Jesus: #TheResistance</pre>
