Text: The word "sinusoid", describing an undulating bendy curve, is derived from the Latin word "sinus", meaning "bend", "fold", or "curve". …But not by the route you'd think.

Text: @sodburger I set my expectations way down, dreading the rote boredom it would surely be. And thus I was able to enjoy it ok; my moviegoing experiences tend to be largely a function of my expectation-setting. Here, archival footage of precisely what I said upon returning from the theater: https://t.co/vehMDKNMC6

Text: @sodburger But, of course, I was in a theater, with no opportunities to pause and go off to do other things, so I got through it in a mere two hours. Like ripping off a Band-Aid; that's my moviegoing philosophy.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby @MCRideordie What's interesting is how sine/sinus, which was originally applied to this concept thru a mistranslation (confusing separate Arabic words) came, centuries later w/the invention of analytic geometry and function-graphing, to be quite apropos, in a way no one considered at the time

Text: @sodburger Right, that's exactly what I thought going in. "This is just going to be a Pakistani version of My Big Fat Greek Wedding". And it's not false, but by never expecting different, I appreciated some small ways it didn't live down to my expectations. Though I remember none of it now.

Text: @sodburger I think one of the things I liked at the time, which I think I saw somewhere wasn't unintentional, is that at times he let his character come across really poorly. I didn't feel like the movie was celebrating his whininess, just acknowledging that reality. https://t.co/t12wJVRJH4

Text: @sodburger (That quoted tweet isn't perfect because it's about fiction, but the same principle applies; I don't mind watching unlikable characters be unlikable. Unlikability (stupidity, cowardliness, etc.) is an interesting, ubiquitous phenomenon, which stories might as well reflect.)

Text: @sodburger Anyway, I don't know why I'm "defending" the movie. My praise really just comes down to: "By expecting to completely hate it, I was able to not. It was not the worst film; I didn't have to leave the theater in the middle".

I don't actually recommend anyone see it.

(At least, things seem alright re: sis and BiL now. Who knows if they'll flare up again if and when I meet some non-Indian love of my life?)
