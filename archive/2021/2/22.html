<pre>This weekend must honestly be assessed as a failure. But each failure is a lesson setting up the next success, blah blah such platitudes. I say these platitudes not as jokes. I&#39;m going to figure out how to make myself actually finish this thing, while still enjoying other things.</pre>

<pre>I come to. What is going on? I cannot see anything. The doctor informs me it was a very bad accident. I have been blinded and may never walk again. &quot;How horrible!&quot;, I cry. The doctor and my family, all mouth agape with shock, chide me for my rank ableism.</pre>

<pre>@neoliberal_dad @len0killer If you mean to make the jargon pun, and I suspect you do, I must note that normal numbers aren&#39;t of any interest arithmetically, only qua digit-sequences. No one&#39;s ever shown any quantity of natural arithmetic interest to be normal. But this thread is only for jokes.</pre>

<pre>This is cool, but I sort of don&#39;t understand at this level why this even needed to be done by sampling. Seems like you could just synthesize the notes directly, at that level of unrecognizably original composition from generic instrumentation. https://t.co/I5RwUeaJtP</pre>

<pre>I like Daft Punk. I listen to them all the time. One More Time isn&#39;t my favorite, but whatever, I have nothing against it. I like sampling, because I was born after 1970. I like this aesthetic. You&#39;re all reading more into my words than I was saying. Please, I have a family.</pre>

<pre>My original post was clearly worded inaptly, so goes the empirical evidence. But I still think it&#39;s funny. This is perhaps a more apt way of communicating what&#39;s funny. Let&#39;s talk about Jews. https://t.co/MQHRcBo0CA</pre>

<pre>@pixelatedboat There&#39;s a sense in which this thing they did is convoluted. I will never back down from this. I am putting my math project on hold.</pre>

<pre>@pixelatedboat Of course I&#39;m including that. Of course that makes it convoluted.</pre>

<pre>@pixelatedboat If my assertion was that Daft Punk should have done something different, then that would be relevant, but that is not my assertion. My assertion is what has happened here over decades is a complex Rube Goldberg process that has resulted in a lovely result. https://t.co/LvtWEEoOBb</pre>

<pre>@extranapkins It&#39;s funny this three note melody was composed by a process involving work over decades by many different people, even though (especially because!) that was the cheapest way for the ultimate composer to get it and the only way with that aesthetic. That all just makes it funnier.</pre>

<pre>When Swizz Beatz took the Justice sample and used it to make &quot;On To The Next One&quot; for Jay-Z, I thought it was cool. But I still think he could have just found kids to sing it.</pre>
