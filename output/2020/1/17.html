Text: Personally, I cannot support a sentence of life in prison, without ensuring sleep deprivation. All in solitary confinement of course. Perhaps some kind of needles under the nails as well? Castor oil, and strappado. The maximum, maximum, maximum punishment. https://t.co/rHfEfYV27F

Text: The tetrahedron, cube, and octahedron were known since time immemorial. As for the other Platonic solids, it is said the ancient Greeks discovered the dodecahedron by looking at pyrite crystals (which often take on this arrangement) and the icosahedron by examining virus capsids.

Text: One day, I will awake and find I've forgotten how to walk. It is to be expected. Memory goes in one's old age, and I learnt it so long ago; a toddler at the time. Just the way of the world. Both my grandfathers got so old, they forgot their Day 1 lessons on being alive.

Text: @djamesalicious @bridgietherease @nytdavidbrooks I see a lot of people theorizing this as what Brooks is getting at, but so little explanation is given that I really don't know. He just tosses out the one line and moves on, comfortably sinecured.

Text: [Bloody and bruised]
I'll never tell! You'll get nothing from me!

No! No, my most controversial movie opinions are a secret I will take to the grave!
