Text: I use my real picture as my avi, to force my posts to be good. If I ever fucked up, people would post my avi right back at me; scores of replies with nothing more. Whenever I see anyone else doing the same, I follow immediately. The worse the photo, the surely greater the posts.

Text: Bret Stephens is bad.

[It is pointed out that there are instances in historical record of the Nazis calling their victims "bad". I retract my criticism in shame, and embark on a journey of reflective soul-searching.]

Text: @baddestmamajama @BUSSCRO It sounds like something will be spent, because it sounds like you are advocating that movies of this sort should not be made; it would not be a lossless position to sign onto such worry. Or is your position that we should worry but do nothing? Then, fine. Wish granted.
