<pre>@echolman Out of curiosity, which stuff would that be? To be clear, the reviews of his Dirk Gently show made me suspect I would be frustrated by it, but I haven&#39;t actually watched it.</pre>

<pre>@echolman Ah. I dunno anything about Channel Zero, but it appears Max Landis was just an Executive Producer, not the main creative force behind it, so perhaps you&#39;re in the clear!</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby Admittedly, it&#39;s him as a person that&#39;s been more offputting to me than anything else, and I am capable of separating artist from output in many other cases, so, begrudgingly, perhaps I shouldn&#39;t be super quick to judge.</pre>

<pre>@FrankieG_Baby I haven&#39;t actually watched his Dirk Gently, and I always hate when people judge shows/movies/whatever without actually watching them, so in retrospect, these weren&#39;t the best tweets and I&#39;ll leave it at that.</pre>
