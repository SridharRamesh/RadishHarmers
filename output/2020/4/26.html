Text: @donorsHATEhim There's no presumption here that this sequence will contain all the reals. It's just that, if you construct the transfinite sequence in this particular way from a map from naturals to reals, the sequence must eventually come to an end at an element not in the range of the map.

Text: @donorsHATEhim This sequence will definitely not contain all the reals, since there will be lots of reals left out between any two consecutive values within it. That's ok, there's no presumption here that this sequence will contain all the reals or all the reals in the range of our map even.

Text: @marx_knopfler There are intuitionistic contexts where 2^N is the surjective image of some subset of the naturals (e.g., this happens in the effective topos, where sending naturals coding total computable functions to the total computable functions they encode hits all of 2^N).

Text: @marx_knopfler In these contexts, one has many different definitions of the reals available (they come apart intuitionistically), but I believe this argument would still make, e.g., the Dedekind-MacNeille reals unsurjectable by subsets of naturals. I haven't fully thought this through, though.
