Text: @nypost This stuff is never actually the top searches, only the most locally distinctive searches. The top searches are going to be the same across lots of states. The locally distinctive ones will of course be nicher. Anyway, bring back the other map where NJ is super into Indians.

Text: @haikugoat This is all based on a throwaway comment by G√∂del in his 1931 paper on the incompleteness theorem, not on anything Peano himself once said, but even G√∂del attached it no importance and primarily worked with a much more expressive system to start.
