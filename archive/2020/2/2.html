<pre>The population of Iowa isn&#39;t even that large. They&#39;ve probably all been polled several times already. At this point, no polling can be trusted, due to the statistical phenomenon known as &quot;oversampling&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@jeremyjkun @dodecahedra What practical benefit do you get by calling them the same? Why not call them &quot;different&quot; and disambiguate what you mean if/when it matters?</pre>

<pre>@dodecahedra Are

f: ℤ/2ℤ → Colors
f(0) = Red
f(1) = Blue

and

g: ℤ → Colors
g(2n) = Red
g(2n + 1) = Blue

the same function (domains are not real) or different functions?</pre>

<pre>@jeremyjkun @leland_mcinnes @dodecahedra The original post gave an example of when that distinction is helpful: when you want to be able to say some functions are surjections and other functions are not surjections, you need to consider the data of a function as including a codomain potentially distinct from its range.</pre>

<pre>@jeremyjkun @leland_mcinnes @dodecahedra It is of course also the case that sometimes one does not want to bother with such a distinction. Everything in math is always context-dependent. Are the ring of complex numbers and the ring of [[a, b], [-b, a]] matrices the same or different?</pre>

<pre>@jeremyjkun @leland_mcinnes @dodecahedra Is the homotopy group of the circle the integers? Are the set {Yes, No} and the set {0, 1} the same or different? Is the speed of light 1?</pre>

<pre>@jeremyjkun @leland_mcinnes @dodecahedra Sometimes, one wants to identify them along a thus elided isomorphism and sometimes, one has reason not to. Every instance of &quot;same&quot;/&quot;different&quot;, or any other preformal language for that matter, is context-dependent.</pre>
