<pre>@martsendo How SHOULD I think of what the concept of a word is, in a cross-language way? Why do agglutinative languages (I think that&#39;s the term, but remember, I know nothing) deserve the analysis of having really long words, instead of thinking of those as just multi-part phrases?</pre>

<pre>@martsendo Surely phrases can also have unpredictable meaning not arising merely compositionally from their elements? But I guess you&#39;re saying words, as the minimal standalone meaningful units, are still distinguished by that minimality.</pre>

<pre>@martsendo Hm, is the suggestion here that I should think of &quot;boa constrictor&quot; as not a phrase but one word?</pre>

<pre>@martsendo I feel like I DO stress &quot;White House&quot; on the first component? But it&#39;s tricky to think about when I&#39;m too self-conscious now.</pre>

<pre>@sheckyyoungman I mean, when we inevitably come in the list of all possible permutations to, say, &quot;Noches y gaymunk&quot;, I think even you will agree &quot;This one isn&#39;t a winner. Let&#39;s hurry along to that Earth-cleansing…&quot;.</pre>
