<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Even after all the kids are rescued, Musk will not give up the round-the-clock work they&#39;ve inspired, confident in its potential. Confident there will still come a day, however far down the line, when he can track down and drown all 12 boys and the coach in his perfect deathtrap.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How convenient that one day&#39;s work cracked both problems (floor wax AND dessert topping!). Frankly, it&#39;s shameful no one ever put that much thought toward either before. (Sure, we&#39;re not all Musks, but perhaps given a full week we could&#39;ve caught up to his weekend?) https://t.co/Lz0EbQNi28</p></blockquote>
