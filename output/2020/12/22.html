Text: This is a shitpost of course, but everybody gets silly about this.

Should 1 be prime? It's not a product of two smaller whole numbers. Should 0 be prime? It doesn't divide a product unless it divides one of the factors.

No. That would fail to cut at the joints. Here's why. https://t.co/GytEeFj9T8

Text: Use words how you want, but there's a reason 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, … gets such attention and not any of these variants with more things added on.

These numbers have all the exact same multiplication properties as each other, and as nobody else, in a precise sense.

Text: If you saw ^ times ^ equals ^, you could be assured that ^ was either zero or one. If you saw ! times ! equals &amp;, well, who knows what &amp; is, maybe it's 9, maybe it's 36, but it's definitely not 3 or 27.

Text: If you didn't know what name stood for what number, well, you wouldn't be able to figure it out exactly. But you could figure out certain things.

Text: Imagine someone wrote down all the facts about what times what equals what, among the natural numbers, but using different names for the numbers, like $ times # equals %, using $ for 5 and # for 4 and % for 20.

Text: In general, it turns out whether two positive whole numbers have the same multiplication properties or not just has to do with their prime factorization. They have the same multiplication properties if each exponent appears the same number of times in their prime factorizations.

Text: So we give 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, … a nice name. We call them the "prime numbers". It would be silly to not have a nice name for them in themselves.

Text: It turns out, all the values in 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, … have the same multiplication properties. There's no way to tell them apart just by multiplication facts alone.

But they're very different from 0 or 1. For example, 0 and 1 are their own squares, unlike 2 or 3 or 5 or 7…

Text: If you can look at the name for A and rule out the possibility of it being the name for B, then A and B have different multiplication properties. You can distinguish them by multiplication facts alone. Otherwise, A and B have the same multiplication properties.

Text: To sum up, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …, are all just like each other but not like other values, so far as multiplication is concerned, so they get a nice name. They get called the prime numbers and nobody else does.

The end.

Text: And zero and one are so special, you can actually pin them down entirely. Only zero turns everything into zero when you multiply by it. Only one leaves everything alone when you multiply by it.

Very different from 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …!

Text: This is THE reason the prime numbers are of importance, to mathematicians.

[It's actually a pretty non-obvious fact. It takes some non-obvious insight to see why this is true, basically because it is non-obvious why prime factorization should be unique in the first place.]

Text: For example, all the squares of primes have the same multiplication properties as each other. All the products of three distinct primes have the same properties. All the products of one squared prime and another two distinct primes have the same properties. And so on.

Text: @ZenoRogue It has caused unfortunate confusion that they happened to use the word "prime" for that. There's no preferential reason for them to have used the word for that instead of calling irreducible elements "prime" or various other equally plausible generalizations.

Text: @ZenoRogue It has led to so much substance-less pedantry about what "prime" really means. Whereas the pedantry I mean to draw attention to has some actual substance. The sense in which 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, … are all similar to each other and distinct from 0 or 1 is real and valuable.

Text: @ZenoRogue As I said, use words however you want, but it's worth being aware why these are a natural bunch to consider in themselves and apart from other values, whatever name you give them.

Text: @willmenaker Seems like a lot of speculation as to how and why they did this but no hard evidence. Still, there have been a million similar silent edits or pulls of things in the streaming world, and it all sucks.

Text: @sigfpe @JadeMasterMath But of course you have a way of measuring k, by taking the derivative. If this is some kind of geometric structure, you can look at a tangent line.

Text: @JadeMasterMath A circle is just some particular kind of curve. Depending on what curves you have access to, you can measure e geometrically all kinds of ways. From hyperbolas, or exponential curves, or logarithmic spirals, or catenaries, or what have you.

Text: @JadeMasterMath Of course, there's no gain to doing it this way. These are just geometric instantiations of the same calculations that could just as well be done as straight calculations.

Text: @feedback_looper @JadeMasterMath You surely can't measure a merely by displacement from the floor, since the floor isn't part of the catenary's dynamics. You can raise the poles by any amount and the displacement from the floor goes up by that amount, without the chain itself changing shape.

Text: @feedback_looper @JadeMasterMath You can measure a in other ways, so this still works. For example, by looking at tangent lines or area.
