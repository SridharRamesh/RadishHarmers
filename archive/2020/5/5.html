<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@kraccdown As it happens, I do the majority of my math in intuitionistic logic by default. I think it&#39;s meaningless to talk about it as the One True Logic, lots of rule systems are interesting to study, but it happens to be the logic relevant to many contexts in which I work.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@kraccdown It is strictly more general than Boolean logic, more things are Heyting algebras (or, essentially the same, cartesian closed categories) than Boolean algebras, and thus &quot;intuitionistic logic&quot; applies in more contexts.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@kraccdown That said, sometimes, one wants to make note of a specifically Boolean argument. So these are both worth having in one&#39;s mental toolbox. Just as sometimes one works with abelian groups and sometimes one works with non-abelian groups.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@kraccdown I don&#39;t know what the article you read was, but it&#39;s worth noting that there are also logics relevant to quantum mechanics that go further in their departure from Boolean logic than intuitionistic logic; i.e., non-distributive &quot;quantum logic&quot; a la https://t.co/8miYaNDOq4.</p></blockquote>
