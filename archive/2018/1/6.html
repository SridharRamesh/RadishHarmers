But maybe I&#39;ll be able to summon the discipline to do it in spare time on evenings or weekends over some months. That would also be very nice, and could maybe, maybe, unlikely but maybe, happen.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@marx_knopfler @rahuldan Well, presumably, the &quot;theorem&quot; is that intervals of &quot;real numbers&quot; are, in fact, connected in this sense. (Although this could still be trivial or nontrivial depending on foundational system; one could choose, or not, to take this as axiomatic to one&#39;s notion of &quot;real numbers&quot;.)</p></blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@marx_knopfler @rahuldan Trivial to what extent? Certainly we must be invoking something special about the &quot;reals&quot;, to distinguish from, say, the rationals with the analogous interval topology. So to prove the IVT is to make explicit whatever that distinguished something is, and its relevance for this.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@marx_knopfler @rahuldan Well, it all depends on how you define the &quot;reals&quot;, as I said. You could take this connectedness as an axiomatic property of theirs, or you could work in a context in which the chain from the reals&#39; definition to their connectedness was not so formally immediate. It all depends.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@marx_knopfler @rahuldan It&#39;s interesting, at least to me, to think about the distinctions possible here in subclassical (e.g., intuitionistic) logics between, say, non-isomorphic structures of &quot;Cauchy reals&quot;, &quot;Dedekind reals&quot;, etc., and how different phrasings of the IVT do or don&#39;t hold for them.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@marx_knopfler @rahuldan To each their own, sincerely. But you must remember, my area was logic and &quot;foundations&quot;, though I don&#39;t particularly like the conception of it as &quot;foundations&quot; (as though one couldn&#39;t properly do math X without first doing math Y, when it is manifestly both possible and normal).</p></blockquote>
