Had to work yesterday and will still have to work tomorrow? Must be a day ending in &quot;sday&quot;.

<pre>Spare me the speech on minimal squared deviation; I don&#39;t care. Generally, I feel that if you have to explicitly draw your trendline on top of the datapoints to make it apparent, it&#39;s not that significant a trend.</pre>
