<pre>@NewTmrw @yeetphilosopher You mean e^(iÏ€) + 1 = 0. Off the top of my head, I don&#39;t see a good b-adic interpretation of Ï€.

I&#39;ll note though that i = sqrt(-1) can be interpreted b-adically for those b whose factors are all 1 mod 4, without having to add it in extra. For example, in base 5, â€¦31212^2 = -1.</pre>

<pre>@NewTmrw @yeetphilosopher We could also study the behavior of e^(ix) b-adically in general. This will only converge for suitable x, but that&#39;s fine. Using this, we can define cos and sin as even and odd components, and we have the usual trig laws for addition, etc. We won&#39;t have Ï€ for periodicity, though!</pre>

<pre>@NewTmrw @foolinthelotus @yeetphilosopher @haramgirlfriend Sure, you can do that. That&#39;s the 16-adics. Note that this is essentially the same as the b-adics for any power of 2 base.</pre>

<pre>@NewTmrw @foolinthelotus @yeetphilosopher @haramgirlfriend Note also, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, 10-adic arithmetic decomposes as a combination of 2-adic (equivalently, hexadecimal-adic) and 5-adic arithmetic. A 10-adic number can be seen as a pair of a 2-adic and a 5-adic number, and all arithmetic just works on these separately.</pre>
