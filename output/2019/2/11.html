Text: At last, after such careful planning, I break into the inner sanctum of celebrity, the Hollywood power circle. I take a moment to steady myself on the bully pulpit, then begin canceling celebs left and right, before ultimately, as authorities arrive, turning the cancel on myself.

Text: Why does anyone watch or discuss the Grammys? When ever in your life have you felt they've gotten things right, that you should produce such gnashing of teeth if they don't choose your fave now? As award-baubles go, my grandma's "World's #1 Grammy" cup carries more credence.

Text: I'm seeing a lot of Beck hate on the timeline. I have no idea what his current output is, but I daresay he has made enjoyable music in the past. It'd be more reasonable to hate paying attention to awards shows, the idea of looking at it all as a big competition, etc. Who cares?

Text: @TKM255 He's a Scientologist (raised as such by his parents). It falls firmly under "Disappointing, but also, I don't care". I'm 100% able to separate art from artist in this case; I wasn't looking to him for religious guidance.

Text: When I was 7, I spent 10 days in hospital on an IV drip with mastoiditis. As such, I found myself eating hospital food each meal. It seemed exotic delicacy, this foreign white cuisine. Pickles made ofâ€¦ cucumber?! To this day, I still kind of think of gherkins as a fancy treat.

Text: Cannot believe the vile slanders I am seeing on the timeline today suggesting the policy agenda of the Israeli state receives support in U.S. politics from AIPAC (whose name, I assume, refers to the innovative artificial intelligence engine controlling the ghosts in Pac-Man).

Text: The relief each Amazon employee feels upon retirement, when they finally get to take that combined dump and leak they've been holding inâ€¦ It is exquisite. It is a level of pleasure most humans never experience, justifying everything, the entire business, on utilitarian grounds.
