<pre>@victoriaxxviii Oh god. This old Redwall &quot;MUCK&quot;, back in 1996. https://t.co/QkefMXQ79g.

If only posts preserved throughout time count, then I think the Straight Dope Message Board is the first place I became an active committed poster.</pre>

<pre>It also sucks (genuinely! It deserves empathy!) if a person has no friends, but for some reason, no one&#39;s itching to start the redistribution pilot there, working out the kinks in that less gendered territory. Somehow, it&#39;s obvious to all what a horrorshow that&#39;d necessarily be.</pre>

Q: What&#39;d the incel say to performatively show their appreciation for an honestly so-so Twitter joke?

----

Ahem. Thank you for your time. Please print the above on a popsicle stick somewhere.</pre>

<pre>@jaubert_moniker I guess. I mean, sort of. I used to work for a similar Internet giant, and my personal level of access was greater than &quot;none of it&quot; but less than &quot;all of it&quot;. Granted, I was just some lowly engineer, but then, so was this guy (or maybe not? Details are scant). So, I&#39;m curious.</pre>
