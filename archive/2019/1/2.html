<pre>Boy, some phrase-coiner out there is going to have a whole lot of egg on their face if, at the end of humanity, the number of people there ever were was 1 or 2 mod 3. They&#39;re really going to regret coining that &quot;egg on one&#39;s face&quot; one.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe @johncarlosbaez @JadeMasterMath I mean, even though math doesn&#39;t have as many as other fields, perhaps, there&#39;s still a bunch, as happens naturally whenever there are phrases one says over and over. Pdf, cdf, gcd, lcm, LHS, RHS... For some reason, I can only think of ones that come in pairs.</pre>
