For instance, the joke I just made is fundamentally the same as Bob Monkhouse&#39;s &quot;They all laughed when I said I&#39;d become a comedian. Well, they&#39;re not laughing now.&quot;.</pre>

<pre>To do anything worthwhile in art, you must force yourself to be original, to push against the tide and shed imitation of all others. This is why Beethoven deliberately deafened himself, the source of his musical talent. This is why Tolstoy never learnt to read or write.</pre>

<pre>@3blue1brown I do not know if this will be helpful for what you are looking for, but this is a little more about the intuition behind how one might come to the gamma function presentation as n! = integral from 0 to infinity of x^n/e^x dx:</pre>

<pre>@3blue1brown The Laplace/Fourier transform tells us how to evaluate fractional derivatives (d/dx)^n for arbitrary n, not just whole numbers [transform, multiply by the appropriate power function, and then transform back].</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>@3blue1brown In this way, we can evaluate (d/dx)^n x^n into a constant n!, or just as well, evaluate (-d/dx)^n 1/x at x = 1 into n!.

The integral definition of n! is just this.</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>@3blue1brown The fact that the gamma function satisfies the recurrence n! = n * (n - 1)! is, from this perspective, the fact that (d/dx) x^n = n * x^(n - 1). That is, the &quot;power rule&quot; of calculus, with whatever explanation one likes best for that.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@3blue1brown As for this integral having appropriate asymptotics, this fits naturally into the general theory of asymptotics of Laplace transforms. It falls out of the observation that the transform of a function which is O(x^n) near the origin will itself be O(x^(-n-1)) towards infinity.</pre>

<pre>@blackpenredpen It sounds bizarre when described as a quadratic equation in 1, but less bizarre when you think of it as setting y = 1/x, rescaling our equation into 1 - 5y + 4y^2 = 0, and solving for y by the quadratic formula, which is what this essentially is.</pre>

<pre>@akivaw @karakfa @3blue1brown Better than log convexity is noting that there is a unique extension of log(x!) satisfying the natural recurrence and also the asymptotic property that some iterated derivative of it approaches 0 as the real component of x approaches +infinity.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@akivaw @karakfa @3blue1brown A few reasons this condition is better than logarithmic convexity is because it is valid for arbitrary real x (not just those which are sufficiently lrge), and we can automatically make sense of it for complex x (which do not come with a ordering to make sense of convexity).</pre>

</p>
<p>
<pre>@akivaw @karakfa @3blue1brown But the main reason this condition is better because, we can apply the exact same condition to many other recurrences. We can apply it to f(x) = f(x + 1) + x^p for arbitrary powers p, for example, and in this way generalize the Hurwitz/Riemann zeta function to arbitrary inputs.</pre>
