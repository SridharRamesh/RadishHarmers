Text: I'd been callously insensitive for years, but having just attempted the challenge of swapping places for one day with my recovering alcoholic roommate, I must admit, my eyes were opened. I had no idea it was so difficult! I couldn't even get past the first of the Twelve Steps.

Text: Like, just the other day, I made a careless silly mistake, and then exploded in shame, calling myself an idiot and a waste and a filthy little Shylock. I've got charming self-deprecation in my bones.

Text: Why are movies, literature, etc, that happen to feature many half-naked men always called "homoerotic"? Why not "for-straight-women erotic"? Can't I just be driving myself into financial ruin with my compulsive consumption of "for-straight-women erotic" art?

Text: Remembering how the coolest kid at Stanford University Math Camp (class of 2001) was asked what base he had made it to with a girl and replied with grinning, put-on bashfulness "0 mod 4". We were all in awe.
