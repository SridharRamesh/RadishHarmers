<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If those were the actual problems, the solution would be strict segregation by affluence (static lists of rich neighborhoods and poor neighborhoods), immigration restrictions, and reduction of workers&#39; salaries.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I feel like some of the discussion around Amazon is framed in a way which has the unfortunate effect of implicitly suggesting it is problematic for people to move to new cities, for neighborhoods to become more attractive to new people, or for employers to pay workers well.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The primary problem is that there is such a thing as having to be able to afford to live in a place at all, such that it is possible to be priced out; that one&#39;s choice in where one can live is determined by one&#39;s income/wealth at all.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">But again, people moving and neighborhoods changing and the existence of tech workers and so on do not seem to me the actual problem, and I think a lot of framing is misguided on this point.</p></blockquote>
