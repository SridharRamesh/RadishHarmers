<pre>@ned_flaczynski I sympathize with you, but one might feel &quot;This statement is not strictly true, it&#39;s either strictly false or neither strictly true nor strictly false&quot; paradoxical even if considered as neither strictly true nor strictly false, as it seems that would then make it strictly true.</pre>

<pre>@ned_flaczynski It&#39;s easy to see how that bothers people. I have sympathy for saying something like what you&#39;ve said as an explanation of what&#39;s going on, but there&#39;s some subtlety in saying this in a way that puts people at ease from the clear source of unease here.</pre>

<pre>@_canarycoalmine @CrazyDogSpirit @Sturgeons_Law I don&#39;t normally explain this sort of post, but in this case, I know there isn&#39;t enough context for you to know otherwise. I am joking in saying the Irish were slaves. Everyone in my circles of Twitter, such as @Sturgeons_Law, understands this as a stock foolish thing people say.</pre>

<pre>@ned_flaczynski The unsettling thing is this:

If it&#39;s neither strictly true nor strictly false, it would seem to follow that it IS strictly true. It explicitly said, if that happened, it should be true.

But if it IS strictly true, then it&#39;s not (neither strictly true nor false).</pre>

<p>
<pre>@ned_flaczynski So it seems like we are faced again with a contradiction, if we start off taking it as neither strictly true nor false.

Maybe that&#39;s fine. Maybe you are happy to accept such contradictions as fine. But being unsettled is a human emotion. You can&#39;t add axioms to remove emotions.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@ned_flaczynski It should also be noted how these antinomies still produce explosive inconsistency even in contexts that explicitly refrain from claiming all things are either strictly true or strictly false, like intuitionistic logic. The antinomies remain antinomies in intuitinoistic logic.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@ned_flaczynski Yeah, maybe. It&#39;s certainly the case that some logicians and laypeople still ponder the paradoxes while most logicians and laypeople just sort of shrug them aside. But that was also true even circa 1900.</pre>

<pre>@ned_flaczynski Even circa 1900 when all this was raging, these discoveries were thousands of years old (consider Epimenides), just suddenly fashionable again because of formal logic. Slow digestion.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@ned_flaczynski I think the real thing is that formal logic overall became very fashionable for a brief period, and is now again no longer such a hot topic, and the hotness of the paradoxes rose and fell with that ride.</pre>

<pre>@whatfreshheck @SurlyDemeanor Much more valuable! Our current curriculum somehow makes everyone afraid of &quot;proof&quot; as some intimidating esoteric thing, instead of emphasizing reasoning and explanation as things we do every day, carried out in ordinary language, just an ordinary conversation.</pre>

<pre>@ned_flaczynski But I&#39;m a logician, if that wasn&#39;t clear, so I have some fondness for these paradoxes still. Indeed, not only am I a logician, but my PhD research was in the area of the incompleteness phenomena and these paradoxes.</pre>

<pre>@tyunwrld This isn&#39;t true except in the tautological sense that anyone referring to themselves is referring to themselves. And even if this were true, it would be no big deal, that&#39;s how the etymology of demonyms/ethnonyms/toponyms often works.</pre>

<pre>@tyunwrld The etymology of &quot;desi&quot; is from originally meaning &quot;land&quot;. It&#39;s about as offensive or weird for others to use as saying &quot;Dutch&quot;, which etymologically comes from meaning &quot;people&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@erasmusNYT Eh, invoking all my academic logician authority: Who cares? A phrase can mean two things. I say &quot;begs the question&quot; all the time to mean begs for the question to be asked, and never to mean circular reasoning. It&#39;s how people speak, it&#39;s fine.</pre>

<pre>@erasmusNYT The fact most people aren&#39;t aware of the circular reasoning meaning is to me a kind of indication they aren&#39;t saying it to sound smarter. They just know it&#39;s a common way they&#39;ve seen a million times to say &quot;raises the question&quot;, so they say it, like any other idiom.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@erasmusNYT It makes just as much sense as &quot;raises the question&quot; or any other idiom.  They don&#39;t think there&#39;s any ambiguity. And indeed, there isn&#39;t. Never in history has this resulted in genuine confusion.</pre>

<pre>I think a lot of people are misinterpreting this situation (on purpose). The New York Times invited Bari Weiss repeatedly to expound in good faith. She couldn&#39;t, and she ended up self-expelling with their encouragement.</pre>
