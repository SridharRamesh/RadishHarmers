Text: @silvascientist In the formal language of vNBG, sure, but this is very dependent on your set theory. Others may just as well be working in some other framework informally.

Text: @silvascientist In many (I daresay most) contexts, one only really wishes to use a "structural" (as opposed to "material") set theory, making this "bijection with a set amounts to a set" approach a more appropriate treatment of set/class distinction.

Text: It's always cool to see modern socialists all at each others' throats over their fealties to the Morchivash regime or the 1893 coup against it or whatever. I am also fond of when the dispute is over compromises the Ruling Council will be choosing between in 2105.

Text: @yeetphilosopher e^20 = …27197858457785818756568221.0

Proof: Check ln(this) = 20 by calculating (this^ε - 1)/ε for ε ≈ 0 (i.e., ε with many initial 0 digits. For example, use ε = 240000.0 or ε = 7000000.0 or whatever).

The closer ε gets to …0000.0, the closer (this^ε - 1)/ε gets to …0020.0.

Text: @yeetphilosopher Put another way, …27197858457785818756568221.0 = sum of 20^n/n! over natural numbers n. Keep in mind that, e.g., 20^5/5! = 3200000/120 = 80000/3 = …33333360000.0, and so on.

Text: @yeetphilosopher Yes. That's precisely what this is; the observation that the theory of exponentials, logarithms, Taylor series, generalized binomial theorem, e, etc, etc, all works perfectly well in the 10-adics, mutatis mutandis. Or well enough: e^x will converge whenever x is divisible by 20.

Text: @yeetphilosopher Almost all the properties for how all these things fit together remain the same; just some of the radii of convergence have to be thought of differently.

Text: @yeetphilosopher You need that x^n/n! acquires increasingly many 0s as n grows large. This means for every prime p dividing 10, the number of factors of p in x^n needs to grow unboundedly larger than the number of factors of p in n!.

Text: @yeetphilosopher The former is n * (the number of factors of p in x). The latter is floor(n/p) + floor(n/p^2) + floor(n/p^3) + …, which can get about as large as n / (p - 1). So the former outgrows the latter once the number of factors of p in x outgrows 1 / (p - 1).

Text: @yeetphilosopher For p &gt; 2, this requires only a single factor of p, but for p = 2, we need more than one factor of p.

Thus, we need x to be divisible by 2^2 * 5, in base 2 * 5.

Text: @yeetphilosopher In general, in the b-adics for base b, e^x converges once x is divisible by rad(b) * gcd(b, 2), where rad(b) is the product of the prime divisors of b (i.e., the squarefree component of b).

Text: @foolinthelotus @yeetphilosopher @haramgirlfriend If you're actually interested, it means imagining decimals that stretch forever leftwards instead of forever rightwards. So you have numbers like …3333.0, instead of numbers like 0.333…. But you calculate with the same rules, about how carrying goes to the left and so on.

Text: @yeetphilosopher @haramgirlfriend @foolinthelotus This is accurate but I'd spin it differently. Kevin is finally learning some basic facts of the field he got his PhD in, yet has been failing to grasp for years. I'm good in all ways and everything I touch is gold.

Text: @foolinthelotus @yeetphilosopher @haramgirlfriend Insofar as almost nothing is known about Pythagoras's life and none of his writings survive… I guess it can't be definitively ruled out. I'll allow it.
