<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wish I could find out when and where these charges are supposed to be from. But the OMNY site won&#39;t tell me unless (maybe?) I tell them the virtual account number Google Pay uses instead of my actual credit card, and Google Pay refuses to tell me that number in full.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Does anyone else get a million MTA PAYGO RECOVER charges in the middle of the night after using using the contactless OMNY subway thing? I usually think they correspond to rides I actually took, but I just got 7 charges after taking two rides yesterday. Now I&#39;m paranoid.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There&#39;s apparently some workaround where if I had a second phone, I could use it as a card reader to find out the virtual card number from my first phone. Stupid system. I don&#39;t have a second phone handy, of course.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@jumhyn I&#39;ve normally had it seem to line up and be within a day or so, but getting seven charges today after two rides yesterday is something I can&#39;t explain that has me worried. And going back through the history, it&#39;s difficult to be sure I&#39;ve been getting charged right, but maybe.</p></blockquote>
