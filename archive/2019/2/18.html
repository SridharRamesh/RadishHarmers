<pre>RT @RadishHarmers: Oh, so even when she says the things you claim to want, you don&#39;t like the WAY she says it? Tsk, tsk. More tone-policingâ€¦</pre>

<pre>@sheckyyoungman No, no. What nonsense is this? Ð” makes an A sound; it&#39;s just a weird way of writing A.</pre>

<pre>RT @RadishHarmers: Modern technology has been a godsend for my love of literature. As Kindles are so much thinner than traditional printedâ€¦</pre>

<pre>@haircut_hippie It&#39;s not so bad. I met my delightful partner, Sridhar Ramesh II, over there. We just clicked from the get-go.</pre>

<pre>@ElBuffaloLoco @gunsmoslem He means &quot;Boo!&quot;, as an attempt to scare me. A successful and viciously personal attempt; he knows my greatest fear is being frightened.</pre>

<pre>@ZachWeiner Boole&#39;s logic is about Boolean operations, dealing with two (or implicitly any finite number, encoded suitably into bits) states that variables can be in. This tends to be how we think of circuits as operating; ON/OFF.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@ZachWeiner Frege&#39;s logic introduces the idea of not just the TRUE/FALSE propositions, but quantification over variables which range over some other domain of no fixed size, possibly infinite. This doesn&#39;t have such a direct analogue in how we think about circuits.</pre>

<pre>@ZachWeiner Moreover, it doesn&#39;t add anything: if all you want to know is what combinations of finitary operations on ON/OFF values are equivalent to what other combinations of such operations, Boolean logic already tells the full story.</pre>

<pre>@ZachWeiner That said, people certainly do some reasoning involving &quot;for all&quot; and &quot;there exists&quot; (the defining features of Frege&#39;s logic, aka predicate logic, aka first-order logic) when thinking about circuits, as they do when thinking about most things.</pre>

<pre>@ZachWeiner It just doesn&#39;t map directly to the circuit structures in itself, the way Boolean logic does, so to speak.</pre>
