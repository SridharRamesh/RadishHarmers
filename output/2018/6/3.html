Text: They say you shouldn't pursue a career as an academic unless you realize you absolutely couldn't bear to do anything else. Well, I hate everything else so much. The trouble is, I also hate academia.

Text: I should never have learnt to code. (Or, rather, I should never have publicly noted I had). My life would've proceeded more interestingly.

Text: Measure my life out in lines of code. Tally up my contributions to employers and to GitHub, and when, at St. Peter's gate, my repo is found lacking, well... I won't put up a fight. I'll accept my fate with dignity; rules are rules.

Text: I'd have an easier time getting a job if they didn't make you perform convincing passion for it. I'm supposed to train to be an actor now, too? If I could do that, I'd just apply directly to acting jobs.
