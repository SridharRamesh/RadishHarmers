Text: I'm what you'd get if David Bowie, subsisting on his diet of milk, chili peppers, and cocaine, decided to get healthy and leave out the cocaine.

Text: I haven't played videogames in a decade, but I may buy a Switch and precisely two games (Mario Maker 2, Mario Odyssey), as some nostalgia-flailing self-birthday-gift. Last time I tried this, I bought a Wii and Super Paper Mario, which gathered dust. But I'm older now. Wiser.

Text: This post itself is a nostalgic relic of an earlier era of social media, where I might just post to tell you what I had for lunch, or how my day was, or what I'm planning to have for lunch tomorrow.

Text: @yeetphilosopher There's no great downside. You have to do something with your time; probably better than tweeting.

Text: @neyvay No, Super Paper Mario. The one with the 2d-to-3d gimmick. I thought it would hit my nostalgia itch about as perfectly as possible, like Mario RPG + classic Mario side-scrollers + hot newness, all in one, but it ended up not capturing my interest very long. https://t.co/m09A30r2Km

Text: @taillogs Oh, shit, I didn't even think about airplanes. I still have in my head that the way it works is my father hooking up the NES to a portable TV on long car rides like a mad scientist.

Text: Punching's a great tactic for taking down our most powerful foes: randos, nobodies, and losers. Senators and CEOs? Only a matter of time till the dominoes fall. Proud soldier of the revolution, I punch cops left and right, wisely, indirectly, through the long arm of the dominoes.

Text: All these street skirmishes are just their own form of politics pageantry, disconnected from anything, winning or losing nothing, but a ready fit for news footage and it looks cool, if you're into that sort of thing, if you yearn for that macho image. Good job securing the block.
