Text: @dirtbikehayes @KundainasheB @realest_lk Cuz her adrenaline's high and she's fucking terrified cuz a guy began chasing her at night, growling and calling her a dumb bitch?

It sucks to have to worry whether she was initially anxious on racial grounds, that's unfair, but her fear at the end of this is very understandable

Text: @neyvay It really isn't (tho I realize it's also boring of me to yuck on people's yum or whatever, as I do all the time). But, yeah, such a mundane nothing-story, only of note if you happen to actually be in the workplace where it's unfolding and need to distract yourself till clockout.

Text: @brocialistmeme It's true. (But also, my grad school years were in the same vein; my abandoned PhD thesis was on a category-theoretic account of Gödel incompleteness phenomena. Friends advised me to name my key concept an "SR-category", the "SR" standing of course for… "self-reference".)

Text: I love climbing up, ever closer to God's kingdom in Heaven, but I hate falling down, towards the dirt and the skeleton army within, so rollercoasters are a real whirlpool of emotions for me.

Text: @rogerbellin So simplistic and reductive of the "Bell Curve" set to suppose all cognitive ability boils down to one objectively measurable number. It is, of course, actually governed by two numbers (in conjunction with various die rolls).

Text: Doing my taxes on April 1st to take advantage of the long-unplugged “You can claim whatever you want so long as you later shout ‘April Fools'!’” loophole. Punctuating this sentence was an ordeal, and the results remain unsatisfactory.

Text: @BreadvanWinkle @rogerbellin I'm also worried perhaps I should have classified Charisma as a cognitive ability, raising the number of numbers to three. All around, my quips could use some work. My Quip stat (the fourth cognitive ability) needs some raising.
