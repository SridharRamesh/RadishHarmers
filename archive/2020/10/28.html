<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why are you all so willing to say somebody else deserves such deference from you? As though you&#39;ve ever had a positive helpful interaction with them in your life, and yet still you are so sworn to them. I don&#39;t have any novel insight to share, it&#39;s just always frustrating.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Talking to anyone a bit older than me, parents or such, it&#39;s like religious dogma that cops are always in the right. They can do whatever they want, and they have authority, and doing what they say not to makes you wrong by definition. This whole concept of authority is a bother.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@just_takes I&#39;m 35, but to be clear, when I said parents or such, I didn&#39;t mean anyone with kids. I meant my parents or such. Also, of course, there are older people who aren&#39;t pro-cop, but I don&#39;t run into them, and I suspect the aggregate statistics on views by age do play out in this way.</p></blockquote>
