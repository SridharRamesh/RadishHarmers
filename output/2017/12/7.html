Text: @echolman Out of curiosity, which stuff would that be? To be clear, the reviews of his Dirk Gently show made me suspect I would be frustrated by it, but I haven't actually watched it.

Text: @echolman Ah. I dunno anything about Channel Zero, but it appears Max Landis was just an Executive Producer, not the main creative force behind it, so perhaps you're in the clear!

Text: @FrankieG_Baby Admittedly, it's him as a person that's been more offputting to me than anything else, and I am capable of separating artist from output in many other cases, so, begrudgingly, perhaps I shouldn't be super quick to judge.

Text: @FrankieG_Baby I haven't actually watched his Dirk Gently, and I always hate when people judge shows/movies/whatever without actually watching them, so in retrospect, these weren't the best tweets and I'll leave it at that.
