<pre>Between good ones, I often do hacky tweets of a sort I&#39;d grumble at if I saw a comic do the same sort of &quot;joke&quot; in an actual show; trite shitty comedy. Flailing around on the flailsite, seeking attention. But I recognize my sins. I have the good taste to keep that stuff confined.</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence I agree. I was too skittish, too untrusting of the audience here.</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence What I really wanted to say was something like &quot;Rather, with a devious grin, I lie and lie some more; first down, then about my breadth&quot;. But I did not play to the top of the audience&#39;s intelligence. I took them for the simpletons my competition trucks in.</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence I have corrected my failings. Maybe. The trouble with this site is no room to polish wording over time, no edit button or repeat performances; everything is one and done. (Well, one and done and endlessly RTed, in my case, but the numbers disaggregation disincentivizes reworking)</pre>

<pre>Every night, I review myself, assigning both a presentation and a technical merit score, out of 6 points each. I stare at my numbers like a dieter at their scale. My therapist says this is rather unhealthy; she insists a unified ten point system would be more accurate and robust.</pre>
