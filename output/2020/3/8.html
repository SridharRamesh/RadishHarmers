Text: @marx_knopfler I have a very dim view of even the theoretical value of this "Sophisticated summing up of what we 'know' right now, while allowing for huge landscape shifts later" understanding of these. I do not see significant actionable value in these models beyond just reporting the polls.

Text: @marx_knopfler @Clouvas I'd stick to "It's all meaningless. This is Knightian uncertainty. It is no more well-represented by a number than by a monoid or color. One may reasonably use language like 'plausibly' or 'rather unlikely', but the false precision of these numbers has no empirical meaning".

Text: It'll be cool when Ilhan Omar or Rashida Tlaib or such runs for president, so the left can be on the nicer side of the gender or racial equality proxy many naturally take such elections to be. It'll also be cool when we abolish the presidency, ASAP, before a POC woman gets in.

Text: @jikkler @benedict_rs @Sturgeons_Law @windcomecalling I appreciate your concern, but note many participants in this latest mockery are themselves South Asian. Me, I'm too much of a sweetheart to go after the guy for this, but certainly even South Asians may well find some traditional South Asian practices to be worthy of mockery.
