Text: Some of the "Fuck off, there's nothing wrong or insular about the country that doesn't let its people leave or use the Internet" countercommentary is also mindboggling and embarrassing.

Text: That "Give us your USB drives. We promise we'll delete what's on them, to reuse them for a good cause" thing at a conference for supposed security experts is mindboggling. Everyone buying into that is being embarrassingly foolish, I agree. But...

Text: Me: Ow, ok, that's enough! Too much!

[Gazing around her apartment, I notice for the first time the debris of abandoned attempts to untie cherry stems. Reidemeister move diagrams marked with ???; a Jones polynomial calculation scribbled out. My darkening dick has lost sensation.]

Me: I want you to hurt me.

Her: [Finally puts into action the cherry stem tongue tie trick that attracted me to her in the first place, leaving my dick in a painful knot.]

Text: @e_f_bartlam @abigailb @noncanadianguy @PulpLibrarian Lewis Thornton Powell (photographed by Alexander Gardner). And there are lots of photos from the shoot, and in some he looks directly at the camera. But, yes; the photos manage to look strikingly modern.

Text: @jcreed I'll digest the context in a bit. For further clarification, when you write x^n x^{n'}, those are indeed meant to be the same x so that this is the same as x^{n + n'}?

Text: @jcreed Call your original function f(x, z). Then what you are interested in is the h^0 coefficient of f(hx, hz) f(x, h^{-1}), construed as a power series in h.

Text: @jcreed Beware that as a power series in h, this extends both into arbitrarily large positive and arbitrarily large negative powers, so if you actually care to treat these as more than formal power series, you will not have good convergence properties. But as formal series, it's fine.

Text: @jcreed Disclaimering my disclaimer, I should say, so far as this positive and negative powers of h thing goes, it can still converge at |h| = 1, for particular x and z, so it's not completely hopeless to view the object you're interested in "numerically" rather than "formally".

Text: @jcreed In particular, if you understand f(x, z) "numerically"(/"analytically"/whatever the right term) to begin with, to get the h^0 coefficient of f(hx, hz) f(x, 1/h) you're interested in, you can substitute h = e^{it) and take the average value as t varies through the entire period.

Text: @jcreed As for how tf to arrive at it, if you start verifying the formal series works out, you'll see for yourself, but basically, I start with f(x, z) f(x', z') and have to enforce the constraint that the power of z' matches the summed powers of x and z.

Text: @jcreed So first I bring in a new variable h to collect those summed powers together (turning x and z into hx and hz). And to make the power of z' match the power of h, I take z' to be the reciprocal of h and include only the terms where the two match perfectly to create h^0.

Text: @jcreed Finally, you wanted x' = x, so, we do that to finish off.

Text: @jcreed Er, I said "|h| = 1", but I don't really mean that in general; I mean whatever the unique* |h| for convergence is (if any), given the particular x, z, and c_{n,r} in play. But you get the idea (and at any rate, aren't interested in the analytic side, only the formal side).

Text: @jcreed *: Not unique sometimes because the power series sometimes works out to have only zero coefficients beyond some point.

(I try to say only true statements while discussing math, but Twitter length constraints make it difficult, on top of the usual difficulties...)

Text: Spotted a guy on my flight in a Pickle Rick shirt, and I feel rage. But why? He's just a guy who likes a show; just someone fond of a thing. Do I lash out in frustration at my own atrophied ability for joy? Must anhedonia turn to misanthropy? I hope the plane crashes so he dies.
