Text: It tickles me when folk get furious at the idea of food stampers buying lobster or escargot. If not for caprice of history and the French, that shit'd be what you'd point to as right for them to eat: just big bugs!

[Boy, can't wait to hear my Twitter friends weigh in with praise for this accomplishment! I'm sure they'll have plenty to say.]
