<pre>Hm, only watched parts so far, but given where I&#39;m up to, it seems to have completely elided mention of Garry Shandling&#39;s picket line crossing incident. The doc mentions how Mitzi Shore didn&#39;t used to give him spots, and then she did, but not the pretty big event in the middle.</pre>
