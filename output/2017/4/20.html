Text: @jeffhubbs 2000 Nazis marched on Munich, killing 4 in attempted coup. Maybe 300 red hatters showed up in Berkeley to sneer taunts and seize a dumpster.

Text: There IS a group in the US today which is racist, fascistic, and genuinely, alarmingly (murderously!) powerful: cops. Go brawl with them.

Text: @jeffhubbs How do the Berkeley scuffles effectively punch any of these folks? Please, show me the footage of Bannon getting punched; I would relish it.

Text: @sqrtnegative1 @pattymo @randygdub That's exactly what it is, but cold-pressed has no real benefits, and regardless, how's buying bags beat buying cold-pressed juice in store?

Text: @jcollie44 Of course this is recursive; a_{n + 1} is specified in terms of a_n and n, same as when (n + 1)! is recursively defined as n! * (n + 1).

Text: @jcollie44 It just so happens that there's a nicer recursion possible  (a_{n + 1} = 2a_n - 5) which makes no use of n, and is easier to calculate with.
