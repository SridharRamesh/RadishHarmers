<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@Sturgeons_Law @dignified_n_old @_curlytrill The probability distribution for the accuracy of a sample of N independently random people out of a population of size P depends solely on N and the actual fraction of the actual population who&#39;d answer each way, but doesn&#39;t at all depend on P, or on how large N is compared to P.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@Sturgeons_Law @dignified_n_old @_curlytrill Sure. Bigger is always better. I shouldn&#39;t really say &quot;extremely representative&quot;, but it&#39;s representative enough. I mean, these kinda polls are all flawed, they have myriad failures to correspond to ultimate vote tallies, and we saw the failure of trusting them too much in 2016.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@Sturgeons_Law @dignified_n_old @_curlytrill But as a mathematician, it irks whenever I see people appearing to say that it&#39;s important that the sample size be large in proportion to the population, when the population size completely doesn&#39;t matter (for the probability distribution of the results of independent samples).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ebarcuzzi @Sturgeons_Law @dignified_n_old @_curlytrill These kinds of probabilities are meaningless. Sam Wang called the election a 99% probability win for Clinton at one point. What is the actionable value in this kind of forecasting if even saying something like that shouldn&#39;t be interpreted as a failed prediction?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ebarcuzzi @Sturgeons_Law @dignified_n_old @_curlytrill In the polling problem, there is a clear frequentist interpretation to the probability distribution over random samples and the probability numbers one might thus discuss. (They&#39;re all a little backwards from what one really cares about, but they at least have a real meaning.)</p></blockquote>
