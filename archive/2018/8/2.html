<pre>Oh, it&#39;s over Elon Musk stuff? Ah, I can think of one Twitter user who&#39;s said quite a lot worse, so far as false statements concerning others go, than an &quot;I&#39;m Elon Musk&quot; joke...</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe In many ways, it&#39;s rather silly and distracting to have standardized on defining elements of quotient objects as &quot;subsets of the original object that comprise equivalence classes&quot;, instead of just &quot;the same elements as before, but with a coarser notion of equality between them&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe (Of course, sooner or later, one will confront an object whose elements are subsets of another object regardless; with powersets, if nothing else. But as your experience notes, it can be an unduly confusing presentation for concepts where it is not intrinsically needed.)</pre>

<pre>@sigfpe Should be no more problematic than having a lot of different sets! 

(Especially on re-quotiented objects, who wants to think of equivalence classes of equivalence classes of equivalence classes of…? No one actually thinks that way about them, so we can skip the pretending.)</pre>

<pre>&quot;Get rich quick scheme&quot;? Well, sure, in some sense… in the sense that you&#39;ll actually get rich! See, what most people do is, they buy a ticket, but that&#39;s it. No commitment; they don&#39;t have it in them, they&#39;re lazy. The difference with my system is, step 2: &quot;Win the lottery.&quot;</pre>

<pre>Looking back from the distance of time, everyone is flattened. The opinions I had in 2012 aren&#39;t the same as I have now in 2018 (not just archetypally opinion-y opinions; my ways of thinking about math have changed too, and so on).</pre>

Whenever I need them but have forgotten what they are, instead of hunting through the house for a musty checkbook, I just post this, and some dumb sap gets scammed into helping me out.</pre>

<pre>It&#39;s time I come out and admit it: I, uh… I&#39;m a feet guy.

I know! Everyone here mocks us! But, argh: I generally find women who have feet more attractive than women who lack feet. (Just one of those paraphilias; I can&#39;t even remember what formative experience made me this way.)</pre>
