<pre>@DoubleEBooks If there&#39;s a joke or anything in the original photo, I missed it, but I had actually looked up what movies were playing at this very theater about twenty seconds before seeing that tweet.</pre>

<pre>RT @RadishHarmers: An apology is an impossible ritual we pretend people are extra remiss for falling short of.

There is no apology anyone…</pre>

<pre>@quasicoherence Those are good examples.

To be perfectly clear, I don&#39;t actually personally have the attitude of &quot;There are no non-non-apologies&quot;. Rather, this was me reflecting and remarking on how I think the reaction to public apologies almost always goes, in the circles I live in:</pre>

<p>
<pre>@quasicoherence I always see some facet of the wording or another used to say &quot;That wasn&#39;t a REAL apology&quot;. But it&#39;s not really the wording that&#39;s the problem; the suggestion that some other wording would&#39;ve escaped ire is erroneous, even disingenuous.</pre>

<p>
<pre>@quasicoherence Rather, the problem is that, no matter what, words can&#39;t dissipate anger at the original offense, and, as you noted, it takes a longer series of future events to demonstrate change and contrition. It&#39;s not possible to say any choice of words right away that will demonstrate this.</pre>

<pre>Perhaps I&#39;ve shifted slightly, now that I have a job, but only because I now see the broader perspective. Anyway, look forward to my series of posts on why capitalism (with regulation, ofc) remains the greatest system society has yet devised for distributing its scarce resources.</pre>

<pre>Seeing a lot of side-by-side posts about &quot;avi perjuries&quot; that don&#39;t actually seem perjurious at all (or even notably bad looking).

You just don&#39;t like the person and are pretending it manifests in every facet of their being, that&#39;s all. If you did, they&#39;d look perfectly normal.</pre>

<pre>The one all-time great &quot;avi perjury&quot; was Kurt, and honestly, hat&#39;s off in admiration; that was masterful and clever and we should all figure out so well how to present ourselves in our best light.

(But all these other alleged instances are like &quot;See? IRL, they face THIS way…&quot;)</pre>

<pre>@JoeHeavner A mnemonic you may find useful is thinking of a wedge as a letter A, for AND. (Actually, the vee comes from Latin &quot;vel&quot; for OR, but that may not be as memorable.)</pre>
