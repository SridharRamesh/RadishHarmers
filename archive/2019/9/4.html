<pre>For an American audience, the ins and outs of British politics can be hard to follow, but this is roughly equivalent to your &quot;Spaer us the theaterics&quot;.</pre>

<pre>@BUSSCRO In earnestness, I recognized it&#39;s wiser to not be a part of trivial dumb outrage-hype cycles, than to be a part of them while claiming self-awareness about their nature.

In non-earnestness, I see nothing funny about this man&#39;s name, and frankly, am offended by your xenophobia.</pre>

<pre>@magi_jay @BernieSanders This is the mildest of criticism. Not even criticism; disagreement. You asked a question about Bernie Sanders, and someone answered in a pro-Bernie, pro-poor people way, with no insult to you. They just thought he was good, while you think he is bad. How is this harassment?</pre>
