Text: @noahdmancino I had to look it up (I presume this is the exact same as Go), but yes. A few times. My nerd friends are obsessed with it, but I've never gotten so into it, perhaps because I only ever find myself playing with nerd friends who are ten times more experienced with and better at it.

Text: Everyone's description of How To With John Wilson made it sound like a show I would be utterly bored by, like some hipper variant of Humans of New York pablum. They neglected to mention that it actually is full of jokes someone sat down and came up with, and thus is great.
